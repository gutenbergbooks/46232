<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="dropleftmin">N</span> THE preparation of this book the author
has tried to give an interesting account of the
invention and workings of a few of the
machines and mechanical processes that are making
the history of our time more wonderful and
more dramatic than that of any other age since
the world began. For heroic devotion to science
in the face of danger and the scorn of their fellowmen,
there is no class who have made a better
record than inventors. Most inventions, too,
are far more than scientific calculation, and it is
the human story of the various factors in this
great age of invention that is here set forth for
boy readers.</p>

<p>New discoveries, or new applications of forces
known to exist, illustrating some broad principle
of science, have been the chief concern of the
author in choosing the subjects to be taken up
in the various chapters, so that it has been necessary
to limit the scope of the book, except in one
or two instances, to inventions that have come
into general use within the last ten years. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
"The Boy's Book of Inventions," "The Second
Boy's Book of Inventions," and "Stories of Invention,"
Mr. Baker and Mr. Doubleday have
told the stories of many of the greatest inventions
up to 1904, including those of the gasoline motor,
the wireless telegraph, the dirigible balloon, photography,
the phonograph, submarine boats, etc.
Consequently for the most part the important
developments in some of these machines are
treated briefly in the final chapters, while the
earlier chapters are devoted to new inventions,
which, if made before 1904, did not receive general
notice until after that time.</p>

<p>Although the subjects treated in the earlier
chapters are here spoken of as new inventions, all
of them are not recent in the strictest sense of the
word, for men had been working on the central
idea of some of them for many years before they
actually were developed to a stage where they
could be patented and sent out into the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
THE AEROPLANE</h2>
</div>

<p class="hanging">HOW A SCIENTIST WHO LIKED BOYS AND A BOY
WHO LIKED SCIENCE FOLLOWED THE FASCINATING
STORY OF THE INVENTION OF THE AEROPLANE.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">W</span>HEN, with engine throbbing, propellers
whirling, and every wire vibrating, the
first successful aeroplane shot forward into
the teeth of a biting December gale and sailed steadily
over the bleak North Carolina sand dunes for twelve
seconds, the third great epoch in the age of invention
finally was ushered in. First, man conquered the
land with locomotive, electricity, steam plow, telegraph,
telephone, wireless and a thousand other inventions.
Almost at the same time he conquered
the ocean with steamship, cable, and wireless. Now,
through the invention of the aeroplane, he is making
a universal highway of the air.</p>

<p>Such was the way the real beginning of aviation
was summarized one day to a bright young man who
spent all his spare time out of school at the laboratory
of his good friend the scientist. Always in good
humour, and with a world of knowledge of things that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
delight a boy's heart, the man was never too deep
in experiments to answer any questions about the
great inventions that have made this world of ours
such a very interesting place</p>

<p>The laboratory was filled with models of machines,
queer devices for scientific experiment, a litter of
delicate tools, shelves of test tubes, bottles filled with
strange smelling fluids, and rows upon rows of
books that looked dull enough, but which the
scientist explained to the boy contained some of
the most fascinating stories ever told by man.</p>

<p>Coming back to aeroplanes the boy said, "But
my father says that aviation is so new it is still very
imperfect."</p>

<p>"That is true," answered the scientist, taking
a crucible out of the flame of his Bunsen burner
and hanging it in the rack to cool, "but it has seen
a marvellous development in the last few years.</p>

<p>"It was less than ten years ago&mdash;the end of 1903,
to be exact&mdash;that Orville and Wilbur Wright first
sailed their power-driven aeroplane," he continued,
"but so rapid has been the progress of aviation that
nowadays we are not surprised when a flight from
the Atlantic to the Pacific is accomplished. It
seems a tragic thing that Wilbur Wright should have
been called by death, as he was in May, 1912, by
typhoid fever, for he was at the very zenith of his
success and probably would have carried on his
work to a far, far greater development."</p>

<p>Wright glider in full flight over Kill Devil Hill, N. C.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
After a little pause the scientist continued, saying
that, at the time the Wright brothers made their
first flight they were experimenting with what we
now know as a biplane, or Chanute type glider, at
Kill Devil Hill, near Kitty Hawk, N. C. It is a
desolate wind-swept spot on the coast where only a
little rank marsh grass grows on the sheltered sides
of the great sand dunes. The brothers chose this
barren place for their experiments because here the
winds were the most favourable for their purpose.</p>

<p>They were not ready for their first attempt to fly
in a motor-propelled machine until December 17th,
and though they sent out a general invitation to the
few people living in that section, only five braved the
cold wind. Three of these were life savers from
the Kill Devil Hill station near by. Doubtless the
other people had heard of the numerous failures of
flying machines and expected the promised exhibition
of the silent young men who had spent the
autumn in their neighbourhood, to be just another
such. They were sadly mistaken, for they missed
a spectacle that never before had been seen in all
the history of the world. Nowadays we are familiar
with the sight of an aeroplane skimming over the
ground and then soaring into the sky, but to the five
people who, besides the inventors, were present it
undoubtedly was almost beyond belief.</p>

<p>The brothers had installed a specially constructed
gasoline engine in their glider, and after thoroughly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
testing it they carried the machine out on to a level
stretch of sand, turned it so that it would face the
wind, and while the life savers held it in place the
brothers went over every wire and stay. They felt
perfectly confident that the machine would fly, but
they made no predictions, and in fact spoke but few
words between themselves or to the five men gathered
about the aeroplane. The machine was not the
smoothly finished one we know to-day as the Wright
biplane. The operator lay flat on his face on the
lower plane, the elevating rudder composed of two
smaller planes stuck out in front, instead of behind,
and there were several other important differences in
design, but in principle it was the same machine
that has carried the fame of the American inventors
around the world.</p>

<p>Finally the operator took his place, the engine was
started, the signal was given, the men holding the
machine dropped back and it started out along the
rail from which it was launched. It ran along the
track to the end, directly against the wind, and rose
into the air.</p>

<p>It meant that the air had been turned into a highway,
but the Wright brothers were very modest in
setting down an account of their achievement.</p>

<p>"The first flight," they wrote, "lasted only twelve
seconds," a flight very modest compared with that
of birds, but it was, nevertheless, the first in the
history of the world in which a machine carrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
a man had raised itself by its own power into the
air in free flight, had sailed forward on a level course
without reduction of speed, and had finally landed
without being wrecked. The second and third
flights (the same day) were a little longer, and the
fourth lasted fifty-nine seconds, covering a distance
of 853 feet over the ground against a twenty-mile
wind.</p>

<p>"After the last flight the machine was carried back
to camp and set down in what was thought to be a
safe place. But a few minutes later, when engaged
in conversation about the flights, a sudden gust of
wind struck the machine and started to turn it
over. All made a rush to stop it, but we were too
late. Mr. Daniels, a giant in stature and strength,
was lifted off his feet, and, falling inside between the
surfaces, was shaken about like a rattle in a box as
the machine rolled over and over. He finally fell
out upon the sand with nothing worse than painful
bruises, but the damage to the machine caused a
discontinuance of experiments."</p>

<p>"Thus," said the scientist, we see the record aeroplane
flight for 1903 was 853 feet while in 1911 a
Wright biplane flew more than 3,000 miles from the
Atlantic to the Pacific. In ten years more we may
look back to our monoplanes and biplanes of to-day in
the same way we do now on the first cumbersome
'horseless carriages' that were replaced by the high-powered
automobiles we know now. Some experts in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
aeronautics say that we may even see the complete
passing of the monoplane and biplane types in favour
of some now unknown kind of aeroplane."</p>

<p>Who knows but that the man to invent the perfect
aeroplane will be one of the boy readers of this!
Everywhere the making and flying of model aeroplanes
by boys is looked upon, not only as play,
but as a valuable and instructive sport for boys
and young men of any age. One of the indications
of this may be seen in the public interest taken
in the tournaments of boys' model aeroplane clubs.
Not only do crowds of grown people with no technical
knowledge of aeroplanes attend the tournaments,
but also older students of aviation who realize that
among the young model fliers there may be another
Orville or Wilbur Wright, a Bl√©riot, or a Farman.</p>

<p>So important is this knowledge of aviation considered
that the principles and the practical construction
of model aeroplanes are taught in many of the
public schools. Instead of spending all their school
hours in the study of books, the boys now spend a
part of their time in the carpenter shop making the
model aeroplanes which they enter in the tournaments.
Of course, dozens of types of models are
turned out, some good and some bad, but in the
latter part of Chapter III is given a brief outline
for the construction of one of the simplest and most
practicable model aeroplanes.</p>

<p>Not only the schools but the colleges also have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
taken up aviation, and nearly every college has its
glider club, and the students work many hours making
the gliders with which they contest for distance
records with other clubs. As a consequence aviation
has become a regular department of college athletics,
and intercollegiate glider meets are a common thing.</p>

<p>The epochs of invention go hand in hand with the
history of civilization, for it has been largely through
invention that man has been able to progress to
better methods of living. In the olden days, when
there were few towns and every one lived in a castle,
or on the land owned by the lord of the castle,
war was the chief occupation, and the little communities
made practically everything they used by
hand. When they went abroad they either walked
or rode horses, or went in clumsy ships. Pretty soon
men began to invent better ways of doing things;
one a better way of making shoes, another a better
way of making armour, and the people for miles
around would take to going to these men for their
shoes and armour. Towns sprang up around these
expert workmen, and more inventions came, bringing
more industries to the towns. Inventions made
industry bigger, and war more disastrous because of
the improvement invention made in weapons. Then
came inventions that changed the manner of living
for all men&mdash;the machines for making cloth,
which did away with the spinning-wheels of our
great-grandmothers, and created the great industry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
of the cotton and woollen mills; the inventions for
making steel that brought about the great steel
mills, and enabled the armies of the world to use the
great guns we know to-day, and the battleships to
carry such heavy armour plate; the steam locomotive
that enabled man to travel swiftly from one city to
another; the steamship that brought all the nations
close together; the telegraph, cable, telephone, and
wireless, that made communication over any distance
easy; the submarine that made war still more dangerous;
and finally the aeroplane that makes a highway
of the air in which our earth revolves.</p>

<p>But even from the time of the ancient Greeks and
Romans man had tried to fly. Every nation had its
list of martyrs who gave their lives to the cause of
aviation. In modern times, too, many attempts had
been made to discover the secret of flight. Otto
Lilienthal, a German, called the "Flying Man," had
made important discoveries about air currents while
gliding through the air from hills and walls by means
of contrivances like wings fitted to his person. Others
had made fairly successful gliders, and Prof. Samuel
Pierepont Langley of the Smithsonian Institution
in Washington actually had made a model aeroplane
that flew for a short distance. Also, Clement Ader,
a Frenchman, had sailed a short way in a power flier,
and Sir Hiram Maxim, the English inventor, had
built a gigantic steam-driven aeroplane that gave
some evidences of being able to fly. But these men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
were laughed at as cranks, while the Wrights kept
their secret until they were sure of the success of
their biplane. However, the question as to who first
rode in a power-driven flier under the control of the
operator still is the subject of a world-wide controversy.</p>

<p>It was as boys that the Wright brothers first began
experiments with flying, and though they have received
the highest praises from the whole world,
Orville still is, and until his death Wilbur was, the
same quiet, modest man who made bicycles in
Dayton, and the surviving brother of the pair is
working harder than ever. In telling the story of
their own early play, that later proved to be one
of the most important things they ever did, the
Wright brothers wrote for the <i>Century Magazine</i>:
"We devoted so much of our attention to kite-flying
that we were regarded as experts. But as
we became older we had to give up the sport as
unbecoming to boys of our age." As every boy
knows, kite-flying was one of the early methods of
experimenting with air currents and greatly aided
the scientists in their exploration of the ocean of air
that surrounds the world, eddying and swirling up
and down, running smoothly and swiftly here,
coming to a dead stop there&mdash;but always different
from the minute before.</p>

<p>But before the Wright brothers gave up flying
kites they had played with miniature flying machines.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
They were known then as "helicopteres," but
the Wright brothers called them "bats," as the
toys came nearer resembling bats than anything
else the boys had seen about their home in Dayton,
Ohio. Most boys probably have played with something
of the kind themselves, and maybe have made
some. They were made of a light framework of
bamboo formed into two screws driven in opposite
directions by twisted rubber bands something like
the motors on boys' model aeroplanes of to-day.
When the rubber bands unwound the "bats" flew
upward.</p>

<p>"A toy so delicate lasted only a short time in our
hands," continues the story of the Wright brothers,
"but its memory was abiding. We began building
them ourselves, making each one larger than that
preceding. But the larger the 'bat' the less it flew.
We did not know that a machine having only twice
the size of another would require eight times the
power. We finally became discouraged."</p>

<p>This was away back in 1878, and it was not until
1896 that the Wright brothers actually began the
experiments that led to their world-famous success.</p>

<p>Strangely enough it all started when Orville, the
younger of the two, was sick with typhoid fever,
the same disease that caused Wilbur Wright's death.
According to all accounts, the elder brother, having
remained away from their bicycle factory in order
to nurse Orville, was reading aloud. Among other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
things he read to Orville the account of the tragic
death of Otto Lilienthal, the German "Flying Man"
who was killed while making a glide.</p>

<p>"Why can't we make a glider that would be a
success?" the brothers asked each other. They
were sure they could, and they got so excited in
talking it over that it nearly brought back Orville's
fever. When he got well they studied aeronautics
with the greatest care, approaching the subject with
all the thoroughness that later made their name a byword
in aviation for care and deliberation.</p>

<p>Neither of these two young men was over demonstrative,
and neither was lacking in the ability for
years and years of the hardest kind of work, but
together they made an ideal team for taking up the
invention of something that all the scientists of the
world hitherto had failed to develop. Wilbur was
called by those who knew him one of the most silent
men that ever lived, as he never uttered a word unless
he had something to say, and then he said it in the
most direct and the briefest possible manner. He
had an unlimited capacity for hard work, nerves of
steel and the kind of daring that makes the aviator
face death with pleasure every minute of the time
he is in the air.</p>

<p>No less daring is Orville, the younger of the two,
who is a little bit more talkative and more full of
enthusiasm than was Wilbur. He was the man the
reporters always went to when they knew the elder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
brother would never say a word, and his geniality
never failed them. He also is a true scientist and
tireless in the work of developing the art of aviation.</p>

<p>First, the brothers read all the learned and scientific
books of Professor Langley, and Octave Chanute, the
two first great American pioneers in aviation, and the
reports of Lilienthal, Maxim, and the brilliant French
scientists.</p>

<p>They saw, as did Professor Langley, that it was
out of the question to try to make a machine that
would fly by moving its wings like a bird. Then
they began with great kites, and next made gliders&mdash;that
is, aeroplanes without engines&mdash;for the
brothers knew that there was no use in trying to
make a machine-driven, heavier-than-air flier before
they had tested out practically all the theories of the
earlier scientists.</p>

<p>They fashioned their gliders of two parallel main
planes like those of Octave Chanute. The width,
length, distance between planes, rudders, auxiliary
planes and their placing were all problems for the
most careful study. It was very discouraging
work, for no big thing comes easily. As their experiments
proceeded they said they found one rule
after another incorrect, and they finally discarded
most of the books the scientists had written. Then
with characteristic patience they started in to work
out the problem from first principles. "We had
taken aeronautics merely as a sport," they wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
later. "We reluctantly entered upon the scientific
side of it. But we soon found the work so fascinating
that we were drawn into it deeper and deeper."</p>

<p>The Wrights knew that an oblong plane&mdash;that is,
a long narrow one&mdash;driven through the air broadside
first is more evenly supported by the air than
would be a plane of the same area but square in shape.
The reason for this is that the air gives the greatest
amount of support to a plane at the entering edge,
as it is called in aviation&mdash;that is, the edge where
it is advancing into the air. A little way from the
edge the air begins to slip off at the back and sides and
the support decreases. Thus, it will be seen that
if the rear surface, which gives little support because
the air slips away from under it, is put at the sides,
giving the plane a greater spread from tip to tip and
not so much depth from front to rear, the plane is
more efficient&mdash;that is, more stable, less subject to
drifting, and better able to meet the varying wind
currents. Scientists call this proportion of the
spread to the depth the aspect ratio of planes. For
instance, if a plane has a spread of 30 feet and a depth
of 6 feet it is said to have an aspect ratio of <i>5</i>. This
is a very important consideration in the designing
of an aeroplane, because aspect ratio is a factor in
the speed. In general, high speed machines have
a smaller aspect ratio than slower ones. The aspect
ratio also has an important bearing on the general
efficiency of an aeroplane, but the lifting power of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
a plane is figured as proportionate to its total area.
In order to hold the air, and keep its supporting
influence, aviators have tried methods of enclosing
their planes like box kites, and putting edges on the
under sides. This latter was found a mistake because
the edge tended to decrease the speed of the
flier and did more harm than the good obtained
through keeping the air.</p>

<p>In aviation, as we know it to-day, aeroplane builders
believe in giving their planes a slight arch upward
and backward from the entering edge, letting it
reach its highest point about one third of the way
back and then letting it slope down to the level of the
rear edge gradually. This curve, which is called the
camber, is mathematically figured out with the most
painstaking care, and was one of the things the
Wright brothers worked out very carefully in their
early models. Also, planes are driven through the
air at an angle&mdash;that is, with the entering edge
higher than the rear edge&mdash;because the upward tilt
gives the air current a chance to get under the
plane and support it. This angle is called by the
scientists the angle of incidence and is very important
because of its relation to the lifting powers of
the planes.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Another one of the difficult problems the inventors
had to struggle with was the balance of their fliers.
Before the Wright brothers flew, it was thought that
one of the best ways was to incline the planes upward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
from the centre&mdash;that is&mdash;make them in the
shape of a gigantic and very broad V. This is known
in science as a dihedral angle. The idea was that
the centre of gravity, or the point of the machine
which is heaviest and which seeks to fall to earth
first through the attraction of gravitation, should
be placed immediately under the apex of the V. The
scientists thought that the V then would keep the
machine balanced as the hull of a ship is balanced
in the water by the heavy keel at the bottom. The
Wrights decided that this might be true from a
scientific point of view, but that the dihedral angle
kept the machine wobbling, first to one side and then
righting itself, and then to the other side and righting
itself. This was a practical fault and they built
their flier without any attempt to have it right itself,
but rather arched the planes from tip to tip as well
as from front to rear.</p>

<p>The winglike gliders of Lilienthal and Chanute had
been balanced by the shifting of the operator's body,
but the Wrights wanted a much bigger and safer
machine than either of these pioneers had flown.
In their own words, the Wrights "wished to employ
some system whereby the operator could vary at will
the inclination of different parts of the wings, and
thus obtain from the wind forces to restore the balance
which the wind itself had disturbed." This they
later accomplished by a device for warping or
bending their planes, but in their first glider there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
was no warping device and the horizontal front
rudder was the only controlling device used. This
latter device on the first glider was made of a smaller
plane, oblong-shaped and set parallel to, and in
front of, the main planes. It was adjustable through
the system of levers fixed for the operator, who in
those days lay flat on the front plane.</p>

<p>Thus the two main planes and the adjustable
plane in front with stays, struts, etc., made up the
first Wright glider.</p>

<p>The Wright brothers took their machine to Kitty
Hawk, N. C., in October, 1900, presumably for their
vacation. They went there because the Government
Weather Bureau told them that the winds blew
stronger and steadier there than at any other point
in the United States. Also it was lonely enough to
suit the Wrights' desire for privacy. It was their
plan to fly the contrivance like a boy does a huge
box kite, and it looked something like one. A man,
however, was to be aboard and operate the levers.
According to the Wright brothers' story the winds
were not high enough to lift the heavy kite with a
man aboard, but it was flown without the operator
and the levers worked from the ground by ropes.</p>

<p>A new machine the next year showed little difference
of design, but the surface of the planes was
greater. Still the flier failed to lift an operator. At
this time the Wright brothers were working with
Octave Chanute, the Chicago inventor, engineer and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
scientist whom they had invited to Kitty Hawk to advise
them. After many discussions with Chanute they
decided that they would learn the laws of aviation
by their own experience and lay aside for a time the
scientific data on the subject.</p>

<p>They began coasting down the air from the tops
of sand dunes, and after the first few glides were able
to slide three hundred feet through the air against
a wind blowing twenty-seven miles an hour. The
reason their glider flights were made against the
wind was because the wind passing swiftly under the
planes had the same effect as if the machine was
moving forward at a good clip, for the faster the
machine moves, or the faster the air passes under it,
the easier it remains aloft. In other words, no one
part of the air was called upon to support the planes
for any length of time, but each part supported the
planes for a very short time. For instance, if you
are skating on thin ice you run much less danger of
breaking through if you skate very fast, because no
one part of the ice is called upon to support you for
long.</p>

<p>In 1902 the Wright brothers were approaching
their goal. Slowly and with rare patience they were
accumulating and tabulating all the different things
different kinds of planes would do under different
circumstances. In the fall of that year they made
about one thousand gliding flights, several of which
carried them six hundred feet or more. Others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
were made in high winds and showed the inventors
that their control devices were all right.</p>

<p>The next year, 1903, which always will be remembered
as the banner one in the history of aviation,
the brothers, confident that they were about
to succeed in their long search for the secret of the
birds, continued their soaring or gliding. Several
times they remained aloft more than a minute,
above one spot, supported by a high, steady wind
passing under their planes.</p>

<p>"Little wonder," wrote the Wright brothers a
few years, later, "that our unscientific assistant
should think the only thing needed to keep it indefinitely
in the air would be a coat of feathers to
make it light."</p>

<p>What the inventors did to keep their biplane glider
in the air indefinitely, however, was to add several
hundred pounds to the weight in the shape of a sixteen-horsepower
gasoline motor. The total weight of the
machine when ready to fly was 750 pounds. Every
phase of the problem had been worked out in detail&mdash;all
the calculations gone over and proved both by
figures and by actual test. The planes, rudders, and
propellers had been designed by mathematical calculations
and practical tests.</p>

<p>The main planes of this first machine had a spread
from tip to tip of 40 feet, and measured 6 feet
6 inches from the entering edge to the rear edge,
a total area of 540 square feet. This will show how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
great is the spread of the main planes as compared
to their length from front to rear. The two surfaces
were set six feet apart, one directly above the other,
while the elevating rudder was placed about ten
feet in front of the machine on a flexible framework.
This elevating rudder was composed of two parallel
horizontal planes which together had an area of
eighty square feet. The elevating planes could be
moved up or down by the operator just as he desired
to fly upward or downward. The machine was
steered from right to left or left to right by two
vertical vanes set at the rear of the machine about
a foot apart. They were a little more than six feet
long, extending from the upper supporting plane to a
few inches below the lower supporting plane. These
also were turned in unison by the operator, according
to the direction toward which he wished to fly.</p>

<p>The most intricate device of their machine, however,
was not perfected on their first biplane. This
is the one for maintaining a side to side balance, or
lateral equilibrium, as the scientists say. In watching
the flights of gulls, hawks, eagles, and other soaring
birds, the brothers had observed that the creatures,
while keeping the main part of their wings rigid,
frequently would bend the extreme tips of their
wings ever so slightly, which would seem to straighten
their bodies in the air. The inventor decided that
they needed some such device as nature had given
to these birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
The system was called by the scientists the torsional
wing system, which means that the tip ends
of the wings were flexible and could be warped or bent
or curled up or down at will by the operator. Only
the rear part of the tips of the wings on the Wright
machines could be bent, but this was enough to
keep the machine on an even keel when properly
manipulated. How the Wright modern machines
are operated is fully described on page (<a href="#Page_99">99</a>). The
whole machine was mounted on a pair of strong light
wooden skids like skiis or sled-runners.</p>

<p>To start the early Wright biplanes, the machines
were placed on a monorail, along which they were
towed by a cable. The force for towing them at
sufficient speed was obtained by dropping from
the top of a derrick built at the rear of the rail a
ton of iron which was connected with the cable.
The later Wright biplanes were equipped with
rubber-tired wheels mounted on the framework,
which still retained the skids. Heavy rubber springs
were provided to absorb the shock. With the wheels
the machine could run over the ground of its own
power and thus the cumbersome derrick and monorail
were done away with.</p>

<p>The operator was supposed to lie on his face in
the middle of the lower plane, but in the later machines
a seat was provided for him alongside the engine,
and in still later ones seats for one or two passengers.</p>

<p>The engine which was designed by the Wright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
brothers themselves for this purpose, was a water-cooled
four-cylinder motor which developed sixteen
horsepower from 1,020 revolutions per minute. The
engine w<i>a</i>s connected with the propellers at the rear of
the biplane by chains. The propellers were about
eight feet in diameter and the blades were six to eight
inches wide. The materials used in the biplane
were mostly durable wood like spruce pine and ash,
the metal in the engine and the canvas on the planes.
There was not one superfluous wire. Everything
had a use, and even the canvas was stretched diagonally
that it might fit more tightly over the framework
of the planes and offer less wind resistance, and also
stretch more easily for the wing warping.</p>

<p>Finally on December 17, 1903, everything was in
readiness for the first attempt of these two patient
men&mdash;then unknown to the world&mdash;to fly in a
power-driven machine. That first flight, made practically
in secret amid the desolate sand dunes of the
North Carolina coast, lasted only twelve seconds.
However, it was the first time, but one, in the history
of the world that a machine carrying a man had
lifted itself from the ground and flown entirely by
its own power.</p>

<p>The two succeeding flights were longer, and the
fourth covered 853 feet, lasting fifty-nine seconds.</p>

<p>The inventors were not heralded as the greatest
men of their time. There were no medals or speeches.
The five men&mdash;fishermen and life savers&mdash;who saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
the flights agreed that it was wonderful, but they
kept the Wrights' secret and the brothers calmly
continued their studies and experiments.</p>

<p>The spring of 1904 found them at work on Huffman
Prairie about eight miles east of Dayton. The
first trials there were not very successful and the
brothers, who had worked seven long years in secret,
had the unpleasant experience of failing to show
satisfactory results to the few friends and reporters
invited to see an aeroplane flight. Their new machine
was larger, heavier, and stronger, but the
engine failed to work properly.</p>

<p>Of course this was no great disappointment to
those two silent, determined young men. "We are
not circus performers," they said. "Our aim is to
advance the science of aviation."</p>

<p>And advance it they did.</p>

<p>Their experiments continued, and in 1904 they
made a record of three miles in 5 minutes 27 seconds.
The next year, 1905, they made a record flight of
24.20 miles and remained in the air 38 minutes 13
seconds at heights of from 75 to 100 feet.</p>

<p>All this time the brothers were solving problems
and correcting faults, but in 1904 and 1905 their chief
endeavour was to keep their machines from tipping
sidewise when they turned. Only the most technical
study and the final development of their wing-warping
device solved the problem.</p>

<p>Perhaps the strangest part was the lack of interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
shown in their work by the world and even by their
own townsmen, for, though there had been several
newspaper accounts of their test flights, no great
enthusiasm was aroused.</p>

<p>They were not wealthy and they had spent more
on their experiments than they could afford, so all
this time they had proceeded without attracting
any more attention than necessary. They desired
to perfect their patents before letting the world know
the secret of their inventions, and spent the next
two years in business negotiations. Meanwhile, the
French inventors were making much progress and
soon brought out several successful aeroplanes.</p>

<p>Why was this?</p>

<p>Why was it that the art of air navigation sought by
man since the earliest times should have been discovered
and mastered so quickly?</p>

<p>The answer lies in the putting together of two
things by the Wright brothers&mdash;that is, their discovery
of the kind of a plane that would stay aloft
with the air passing under it at a swift enough clip
to give it support, and their adaptation of the gasoline
engine to the use of driving the plane forward
with enough speed.</p>

<p>When they began work, the gasoline engine was
just coming to its real development. It was light,
developed a high power, and its fuel could be concentrated
into a small space. These things were essential
to the success of the aeroplane&mdash;light weight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
high power, and concentrated fuel. And these were
things that the early inventors lacked. Sir Hiram
Maxim equipped his machine with a steam engine,
while Langley used steam engines in most of his
models. These were very heavy, cumbersome, gave
slight power in comparison to their weight, and could
carry only a little fuel with them.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the adaptation of the gasoline engine
to the use of the aeroplane marked the difference
between mechanical flight and no flight, but it
also is not to be doubted that those aviators, who are
more mechanical than scientific, have overrated the
importance of the engine in aeroplane construction.
Before engines ever were used, the Chanute type
of biplane had to be worked into a state of reliability,
if not perfection. Now the scientific leaders in
aviation are giving every bit as much attention to
the perfection of their planes, their gliding possibilities,
and the scientific rules governing their action
as they are to their engines.</p>

<p>Most boys understand, at least generally, how an
automobile or motor-boat engine works. Scientists
call gasoline engines "internal combustion motors,"
and that means that the force is gathered from the
explosion of the gasoline vapour in the cylinder.
Enough gasoline to supply fuel to run an aeroplane
motor for as much as eight or nine hours can be
carried in the tank. From the tank a small pipe
carries the gasoline to a device called the carbureter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
The carbureter turns the gasoline into gas
by spraying it and mixing it with air, for gasoline
turns into a very inflammable and explosive gas
when mixed with the oxygen in the air. So this
gas, if lighted in a closed space, will explode. The
explosion takes place in the motor-cylinder by the
application of an electric spark, and the force pushes
the piston, which turns the crank and drives the
aeroplane propeller, automobile wheels, or motor-boat
screw.</p>

<p>Thus we have the piston driven out and creating
the first downward thrust, but the thrusts must be
continuous. The piston must be drawn back to the
starting place, the vapours of the exploded gas expelled,
and the new gas admitted to the cylinder
ready for the next explosion. On the ordinary four-cycle
motor two complete revolutions of the flywheel
are necessary to do all the work. First, we must have
the explosion that causes the initial thrust; second,
the return of the piston rod in the cylinder by the
momentum of the flywheel as it revolves from the
initial thrust, thus forcing out the burned gas of the
first explosion; third, the next downward motion to
suck in a fresh supply of gas; and, fourth, the next
upward thrust to compress it for the second explosion.
It sounds simple enough, but it isn't, as every
one knows who has tried to run a gasoline motor for
himself.</p>

<p>The carbureter must do its work automatically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
and convert the air and gasoline into gas in just the
right proportions. A slight fault with the feed of
gasoline or air would cause trouble. Also the
electric-spark system that ignites the gas and causes
the explosions must be in perfect running order. The
explosions cause great heat, so some system of cooling
the cylinders either by air or water must be used.</p>

<p>Only one cylinder has been explained here, but
most engines have several, each working at a different
stage, so that the power is exerted on the shaft
continuously. For instance, take a four-cylinder
engine; on the instant that the first cylinder is exploding
and driving the shaft, the second cylinder is
compressing gas for the next explosion, the third is
getting a fresh supply of gas, and the fourth is cleaning
out the waste gas of the explosion of a second
before. Thus it will be seen why the explosions are
almost constant.</p>

<p>Now think of the aeroplane motor that has fourteen
cylinders and develops 140 horsepower! This is
probably the most powerful aeroplane engine in the
world, although there are many motor boats that
have engines developing 1,000 horsepower.</p>

<p>In the early days when scientists were groping for
the secret of air navigation the best that the clumsy
steam engines they had at their disposal would do
was to generate one horsepower of energy for every
ten pounds of weight. These days the light powerful
aeroplane engines we hear roaring over our heads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
are generating one horsepower of energy for every
three or three and a half pounds of dead weight, and
engines have been constructed weighing only one
pound to every horsepower, though they are impractical
for general use.</p>

<p>The first engines that were used in aeroplanes were
simply automobile engines adapted to air navigation.
The main question in those days was lightness and
power. This was achieved by skimming down the
best available automobile engines so that they were
as light as safety would allow.</p>

<p>Although lightness is still an important factor in
aeroplane engine construction, many authorities
declare that it is growing less so as the science
advances and aeroplanes are able to carry heavier
loads.</p>

<p>There were many intricate and difficult problems,
however, that attended taking a motor aloft to drive
an aeroplane. The motor had to run at top speed
every second, for it could not rest on a low gear
as an automobile engine could. First one part and
then another would give out and the motors were constantly
overheating. Experience taught the makers
how to make their machines light enough and yet
strong enough to do the required work.</p>

<p>It was in cooling that the greatest difficulties were
met, and it was this that brought about the great
innovations in motor building. The system of cooling
the engine with water required much heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
material, such as pipes, pumps, water, water jackets,
and radiator.</p>

<p>On account of the general efficiency of a water-cooled
engine many builders of aeroplanes stuck
to it and developed it to a very high standard.
At present many of the prize-winning engines
are water cooled, as, for instance, the Wright and
Curtiss.</p>

<p>All of these water-cooled engines and several
standard air-cooled makes are of the reciprocating
type that have stationary cylinders and crankcase
while the crankshaft rotates like that of the motor
boat.</p>

<p>The famous Curtiss, Anzani, Renault, and others
are all engines of this type. They all differ, but all
have a high capacity, as we know from the records
they have broken. The Anzani and R. E. P. makers,
whose motors are air cooled, have used to great advantage
the plan of making their motors star-shaped&mdash;that is,
with the cylinders arranged in a circle
around the crankshaft.</p>

<p>This is the shape taken by the famous air-cooled
rotary engines of which the much-discussed Gnome
is the best known make. In this rotary motor the
cylinders and crankcase revolve about the crankshaft
which is stationary. Authorities are divided
over the Gnome, which has many severe critics as well
as many enthusiastic supporters. Its lightness is
certainly an advantage. The ordinary Gnome has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
seven cylinders and develops fifty horsepower while
the newest models have fourteen cylinders and develop
100 and 140 horsepower.</p>

<p>A brief description of the motor here will suffice
to show the general principle of the rotary engine.
The stationary crankshaft is hollow, and through it
the gasoline vapour passes from the carbureter at the
rear to the cylinders. Of course the inlet valves in the
pistons are made to work automatically. The
magneto is also placed behind the motor and the
segments revolve on the crankcase. Wires extend
from the segments to the spark plugs in the cylinders,
and revolve with them. The cylinders are turned
out of solid steel and the whole engine is conceded
by experts to be one of the most wonderfully ingenious
ever built. The cylinders and crankcase
themselves serve as flywheel, thereby eliminating the
dead weight of the usual heavy flywheel in the other
types of motors, and the rotation serves to cool the
engine perfectly. Again, the rotary motor is light
and small, while it develops a tremendously high
power. Aviators also claim for it other advantages
too technical for consideration here.</p>

<p>Many authorities, in fact, declare that the rotary
engine is the aeroplane motor of the future. It is
very popular among the French aviators and at present
holds a great many speed records. It was with one
of these high-power Gnomes that Claude Grahame-White,
the English flier, won the Gordon Bennett race
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
at Belmont Park in the fall of 1910, and Weyman
again in England in 1911.</p>

<p>While this high state of development in the aeroplane
motor has been attained comparatively within
a few years, the art of flying has occupied the mind
of man since it was described in Greek mythology.
The Chinese for thousands of years have used kites
and balloons. The ancient Greeks watched the wonderful
flights of the birds and invented myths about
men who were able to fly. Then Achytes, his mind
fired by these stories, invented a device in the form of a
wooden dove which was propelled by heated air.
Other inventors made devices that were intended to
fly, and during the reign of Nero, "Simon the Magician"
held the world's first aviation meet in Rome.
According to the account, he "rose into the air through
the assistance of demons." It further states that St.
Peter stopped the action of the demons by a prayer,
and that Simon was killed in the resultant fall. Simon
made another record that way by being the first
man to be killed in an aeronautical accident. Other
records show that Baldud, one of the early tribal
kings in what later was named England, tried to fly
over a city, but fell and was killed. A little later, in
the eleventh century, a Benedictine monk made himself
a pair of wings, jumped from a high tower and
broke his legs. These wings really were rude gliders
and the principle remained in the minds of men, even
in those days when their chief occupation was war.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
According to the legends, a man named Oliver of
Malmesburg, who lived during the Middle Ages,
built himself a glider and soared for 375 feet.</p>

<p>It was in the fifteenth century that men first began
to make flying a scientific study by making records
and, in part at least, tabulating the results of their
experiments.</p>

<p>Among these early students of the science were
Leonardo da Vinci, who is best known to the world
as a painter and sculptor, but who was a great
engineer and architect of his time, and Jean Baptiste
Dante, a brother of the great poet. Although Da
Vinci was the more scientific in his experiments,
Dante made greater progress, and it is on record
that he made many wonderful flights with a glider
of his own construction over Lake Trasimene. He
launched his glider from a cliff into the teeth of the
wind, showing thereby his knowledge of the fact that
a glider works best when flown against a high wind,
because in that way the air is passing under it at
greater speed. In one flight he made about 800
feet, which would be a fine record for any glider
manipulated by an expert to-day. Finally Dante
attempted an exhibition at Perugia, at the marriage
festival of a celebrated general, fell on the roof of the
Notre Dame Church and broke one of his legs.</p>

<p>Da Vinci had three different schemes for human
flight. One was the old idea of bird flight, first
dreamed of by the Greeks when Ovid wrote the poem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
of "D√¶dalus and Icarus." Scientists called the
machine that Da Vinci proposed an orthopter and the
operator was supposed by the movement of both
arms and legs to fly by flapping the wings. Needless
to say it did not work, and we know to-day that bird
flight by wing flapping is probably impossible for man.
Another of Da Vinci's ideas is still being worked upon
by some inventors. This was a machine known as
the helicopter, which was supposed to fly upward by
the twisting of a great horizontal screw ninety-six
feet in diameter. The idea was just the same as
that of the toy that started the Wright brothers to
thinking. The trouble with Da Vinci's machine
was that he had no power to run it. Boys in playing
with toy helicopters to-day can run them with
rubber bands, but Da Vinci had to turn his screw
by human power. Little was accomplished with
this machine, although Da Vinci showed its practicability
with models. The third scheme of this
Italian scientist is one that many years later was
perfected and demonstrated at every county fair&mdash;that
is, the parachute. The first parachute was
very crude, but it soon was developed to a fairly
high stage of effectiveness and men came down
from the tops of towers in them without much
injury.</p>

<p>Again, in 1742, the Marquis de Bacqueville, then
sixty-two years old, made a contrivance with which
he flew about nine hundred feet before he fell into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
a boat in the Seine River and broke his leg. The
Marquis had announced in advance that he would
fly from his great house in Paris, across the Seine
River and land in the famous Garden of the Tuileries.
A crowd assembled and marvelled when the nobleman
sailed into the teeth of the wind supported by what
apparently were great wings. Something went wrong
after a flight that would be considered remarkable
by a scientific glider to-day, and his fall resulted
in a broken leg for the experimenter. According to
the authorities, all these experiments were not very
valuable to science, because while the flights were
accurately described the construction of the fliers
(except in the case of Leonardo da Vinci) was not
given, or only indicated in the most uncertain and
unscientific language.</p>

<p>In 1781 a French scientist named Blanchard attempted
to make a flying machine of which the man
driving it was to be the power. He was still working
with it when ballooning became known, and he took
up that sport with avidity.</p>

<p>At that point came the true division between
heavier-than-air and lighter-than-air machines. Before
1783 many scientists had hinted at the practicability
of a hot air or gas balloon, but all successful
flying experiments had been made with what we
suppose to have been some form of gliders. However,
in 1783 Tiberius Cavallo, an Italian scientist
living in London, made a small hydrogen balloon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
and was followed by the manufacture of fairly successful
balloons by the Montgolfier brothers, two
French inventors.</p>

<p>From that time ballooning, with which this chapter
has no concern, made rapid strides, until to-day
the balloon has reached the stage where great motor-driven
balloons are used by the European armies, and
also to carry passengers.</p>

<p>The next step in the heavier-than-air machine,
known these days as the aeroplane, was taken in
1810, by Sir George Cayley, an Englishman and a
true scientist, who constructed a glider and tabulated
much valuable information. It was this scientist
who made the first conclusive demonstrations looking
toward the proof that man can never fly like a
bird, but must proceed upon the principle of sustained
planes. Sir George set down many laws of equilibrium
governing the control of flying machines,
estimated the power necessary to carry a man, and
even hinted at the possibility of a gas engine more
powerful and lighter than the then crude steam
engine. He declared that a plane driven through
the air, and inclined upward at a slight angle, would
tend to rise and support a weight, and also that a tail
with horizontal and vertical vanes would tend to
steady the machine and enable the pilot to steer
it up or down.</p>

<p>This, it will be seen, was a very close approach to
the idea of the aeroplane as we know it to-day. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
remained for another British inventor, by the name of
Henson, to carry these ideas to a further development,
and with his colleague, F. Stringfellow, he worked
out a model that embodied most of the principles
of the present-day flier of the monoplane type. They
decided the proper proportion for the width and
length of the plane and steadied their machine with
both horizontal and perpendicular rudders. In 1844
Henson and Stringfellow built a model of their aeroplane
and equipped it with a small steam engine.
A subsequently constructed steam-propelled model
made a free flight of forty yards. This is claimed
to be the first flight of a power-driven machine, although
it was only a model. In 1866 F. H. Wenham,
another Englishman, took out a patent on an aeroplane
made up of two or more planes, or, as the
scientists call it, two or more superposed surfaces.
Immediately following this, Stringfellow constructed
a steam-propelled model of triplane type, but it was
no more successful than his monoplane. This latest
model may be seen in the Smithsonian Institution
at Washington to-day along with other models marking
the progress of aeroplanes.</p>

<p>In the years following other inventors contributed
much valuable information to the data concerning
aviation. Among these was Warren Hargrave, the
Australian, who had discovered the box kite, and
who had seen in it the principle for the aeroplane.
Hargrave even built a small monoplane weighing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
about three pounds and propelled by compressed air,
which flew 128 feet in eight seconds.</p>

<p>Though the Wright brothers were the first to make
a practical man-carrying, power-propelled aeroplane,
they were not the first men to be carried off the
ground by such a machine. The first man admitted
by most authorities to have flown in a power-driven
aeroplane was Clement Ader, a Frenchman, who had
spent his life in the study of air navigation. His
first machine was of monoplane type driven by a
forty-horsepower steam engine. It was called the
<i>Eole</i> and it had its first test before a few of the inventor's
friends near the town of Gretz on October
9, 1890, making, according to witnesses, a free flight
of 150 feet. Ader built two more machines in subsequent
years and succeeded in interesting the French
military authorities. In October of 1897 he made several
secret official tests of his last machine, the <i>Avion</i>.
It had a spread of 270 square feet, weighed 1,100
pounds, and was driven by a forty-horsepower steam
engine. The day for the trial was squally but he persevered.
The flier ran at high speed over the ground,
several times lifted its wheels clear off its track
and finally turned over, smashing the machine. The
officials did not consider the exhibition successful,
and the support of the army was withdrawn. Ader
in disgust gave the <i>Avion</i> to a French museum and
abandoned aviation, with success almost within his
grasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Shortly before this time Prof. Samuel Pierpont
Langley of the Smithsonian Institution and Octave
Chanute, the great American pioneers in aviation,
were making their early experiments. Professor
Langley experimented with numerous kinds of model
fliers, and finally, on May 6, 1896, launched a steam-propelled
model over the Potomac River. According
to the scientist Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, who
was present, it flew between 80 and 100 feet and then
"settled down so softly and gently that it touched the
water without the least shock, and was in fact immediately
ready for another trial." The second
test was equally successful. The speed was between
twenty and twenty-five miles an hour and the distance
flown about 3,000 feet. Professor Langley's first
aerodrome, as he called it (the word is now used to
mean aviation field), was made in the form of a
tandem monoplane about sixteen feet long from end
to end and with wings measuring about thirteen feet
from tip to tip. The steam engine and propellers
were placed between the forward and aft planes.
The whole machine weighed about thirty pounds and
of course was too small to carry a pilot.</p>

<p>Langley next made a model which took the form
of a tandem biplane, and which had some success
in flights. When the Government appropriated $50,000
for him to build an aerodrome that would carry
a man, Langley began to experiment with a gasoline
engine. He used his tandem biplane and a motor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
that developed two and a half to three horsepower.
The whole machine weighed fifty-eight pounds, and
the planes, which were set at a dihedral angle, had
sixty-six square feet of surface. A successful test without
a pilot was made on the Potomac River below
Washington on August 8, 1903, and while the spectators
and reporters were lauding him the inventor
merely remarked: "This is the first time in history, so
far as I know, that a successful flight of a mechanically
sustained flying machine has been seen in public."</p>

<p>The man-carrying machine was ready for its tests
a few months later. Ever since having been financed
by the Government, Langley had been at work, and
the result was a tandem monoplane much like his
early models. It was driven by a gasoline motor
placed amidships which acted on twin screw propellers,
which also were between the tandem planes.
The whole machine with the pilot weighed 830
pounds, and had 1,040 square feet of wing surface.
It was fifty-two feet long from front to rear and the
wings measured forty-eight feet from tip to tip.
The wings were arched, like those of modern aeroplanes,
and the double rudder at the rear had both
horizontal and vertical surfaces to steer the machine
up or down, or from right to left. The aerodrome
did not have any device for keeping it on an even
keel, such as the ailerons we know to-day, or the
wing-warping system of the Wright machine. This
was a serious drawback, according to the present-day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
scientists, but Professor Langley had set his wings in
a dihedral angle&mdash;that is, like a broad V, to give what
is called automatic stability. This dihedral angle,
it will be remembered, is one of the principles discarded
by the Wright brothers early in their experiments
as one that tended to keep the machine
oscillating from side to side. Professor Langley
realized this, it is said, and to offset it had already
advanced several ideas along the line of wing warping,
for keeping his machine on an even keel when
buffeted by the wind.</p>

<p>The aerodrome also lacked the wheels now used
on aeroplanes for starting and alighting, and even
the skids that were used on the first Wright machines.
His motor was remarkably well adapted to the work.
It developed 50 horsepower with a minimum of
vibration, and with its radiator, water, pump, tanks,
carbureter, batteries, and coil weighed twenty pounds,
or about five pounds per horsepower. The arrangement
of the five cylinders around the shaft like the
points of a star was one that has become very popular
in modern aviation motors.</p>

<p>The first trial took place at Widewater, Va., on
September 7, 1903. The machine was placed on a
barge on the Potomac River; the pilot, Charles
M. Manley, Professor Langley's able young assistant,
took his seat in the little boat amidships, and a
catapult arrangement, like the early Wright starting
device, sent it into the air. To the bitter disappointment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
of Langley and his friends the machine dived
into the water. It came up immediately, the daring
Manley undaunted and uninjured. Investigation
showed that in launching it the post that held the
guys which steadied the front wings had been so
bent that the forward planes were useless.</p>

<p>At the next trial, December 8, the rear guy post
was injured in a similar accident and the machine
fell over backward. This ended the experiments,
as the Government appropriation had been spent,
and the machine was repaired and stored in the
Smithsonian Institution, where it is yet.</p>

<p>Professor Langley died a few years after this,
feeling that his great work had never been appreciated
or understood by the world. Many have
declared that he died of a broken heart as a result
of the frequent ridicule of the public and press. Although
he never saw the triumph of aerial navigation,
he died firm in the belief that it was only a matter
of time and the working out of theories then laid
down until man could fly. His last hours were
cheered by the receipt of a copy of resolutions of
appreciation passed by the Aero Club of America.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Frenchman Ader had actually
flown in a power-driven machine of his own construction,
at private tests, while Captain Le Bris
and L. P. Mouillard, Frenchmen, and Otto Lilienthal,
a German, had been carrying on important
glider flights. Also Sir Hiram Maxim, the American-born
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
inventor who was knighted in England, made
a great aeroplane that was tested with some success.
The machine was built in 1889 and was mounted on
a track. It was called a multiplane&mdash;that is, it had
several planes, one above the other, and was driven
by a powerful steam engine. The whole machine
weighed three and a half tons and had a total surface
of 5,500 square feet. During its tests on the track it
lifted a few inches off the ground. Thus Maxim
claimed that his was the first machine that had ever
lifted a man off the ground by its own power.</p>

<p>It was Otto Lilienthal, however, the "flying man,"
who established a systematic study of one phase
of aviation which became general enough to be called
the Lilienthal School. This was the system of
practising on gliders before attempting to go into
the air with power-driven machines. As will be
remembered, this was exactly the system the Wright
brothers followed out.</p>

<p>Lilienthal's first experiments were made in 1891
with a pair of semicircular wings steadied by a
horizontal rudder at the rear. The whole apparatus
weighed forty pounds and had a total plane surface
of 107 square feet. He would run along the ground
and jump from the top of a hill. He made many
good flights, and in 1893 with a new glider averaged
200 to 300 yards and steered up or down
or to either side at will. Lilienthal found that the
air flowing along the earth's surface had a slightly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
upward current, as science tells us it does, and that
it would carry him upward if the wind was blowing
strong enough. Hence he could go forward either
up or down in about the same way that a yacht tacks
against the wind. But Lilienthal had the same
trouble in balancing that the Wright brothers had
at first, so he kept an even keel as best he could by
swinging his legs and body from side to side as he
hung underneath the glider.</p>

<p>The "flying man" made about 2,000 flights and
then constructed a still more successful biplane
glider for which he built an engine. He was killed
while making a glide on August 9, 1896, however,
and the motor was never used. Several authorities
who were in touch with Lilienthal declared that the
machine had become wobbly and unreliable. This,
they said, was the cause of its collapsing in midair
under the heavy strain.</p>

<p>Lilienthal's death, though mourned by scientists
all over the world, did not interfere with the great
work he had started, for his system had many disciples
both in Europe and America. Among these,
besides the Wrights, were the Americans Octave
Chanute and A. M. Herring, and Percy S. Pilcher
of the University of Glasgow. Pilcher was killed
three years after Lilienthal, September 30, 1899,
while trying to make a glide in stormy weather.</p>

<p>LOUIS BL√âRIOT SHORTLY AFTER
COMPLETING HIS TRANS-CHANNEL
FLIGHT</p>
</div></div>

<p>Great credit must be given to Chanute because it
was in great part through his advice that the Wright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
brothers achieved final success, and all biplanes
to-day are known to the technical side of the aviation
world as Chanute type machines. Chanute
and Herring started experiments with gliders among
the sand dunes on the southern shore of Lake Michigan,
and, after some indifferent success with the Lilienthal
monoplane type of glider, made a flier of five
surfaces one above the other. The rudder was in
the rear and the pilot hung below the machine.
One by one experiments pared down the number
of planes to three and then to two. The planes were
arched, as they are in modern aeroplanes. The
rudder extended behind the contrivance and had
both horizontal and vertical blades. The whole machine
weighed 23 pounds and had 135 square feet of
plane surface.</p>

<p>The biplane was eminently satisfactory and Herring
decided to make an engine for it and sail in a
power-driven flier&mdash;or a dynamic aeroplane, as
the scientists call it. His motor was a compressed
air machine and he proposed to go into the air as if
for a glide and then start the engine. According
to newspaper accounts, he accomplished this and his
compressed air engine drove him forward seventy-three
feet in eight or ten seconds against a strong
breeze. The flight was not given very much consideration,
however, for lack of authoritative witnesses.</p>

<p>This brings us around again to the activities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
the Wright brothers, who started their work with
the glider built along the lines laid down by Octave
Chanute. They had the active support and aid of
this inventor throughout their three or four years of
experiments, although many other scientists were inclined
to discredit their work.</p>

<p>While the brothers were going ahead with their
practical flier the European scientists were developing
with rapid strides and Prof. John J. Montgomery of
Santa Clara College, Santa Clara, Cal., who was killed
in a glider accident in 1911, was astonishing the far
West with gliding experiments of great importance.</p>

<p>Montgomery's best glider was a tandem monoplane
with a device by which the pilot could change
at will the amount of curvature of any of the wings.
This gave him the tremendous advantage of being
able to vary the lifting power of the wings independently
of each other and hence a means of maintaining
side to side balance. Professor Montgomery made
his own flights until injuring his leg in alighting,
and then he hired trained aeronauts to glide from
great heights. As it turned out it would have been
better had he never resumed flying himself. He used
balloons to carry up the gliders and when they reached
the required altitude the operator cut the cable.
Daniel Maloney, a daring parachute jumper, and
two other aeronauts, named Wilkie and Defolco, carried
on these hair-raising experiments.</p>

<p>Flights were made at Santa Clara, Santa Cruz,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
San Jos√©, Oakland, and Sacramento, in 1905. The
balloon would take up the aeroplane, and aviator,
who sat on a saddle like a bicycle seat between the
tandem planes and manipulated the wing control
and rear rudder with hand levers and a pair of stirrups
for his feet. In April of that year a forty-five-pound
glider, such as the one described, with Maloney
in the seat, was taken up four thousand feet. When
the aviator cut loose he glided to earth, making evolutions
never before made by man in the air, and finally
landed as lightly as a feather on a designated spot.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward Maloney while making a sensational
glide was killed. As the balloon was rising
with the aeroplane, a guy rope switched around
the right wing and broke the post that braced the
two rear wings and which also gave control over the
tail. Those below shouted to Maloney that the
machine was broken, but he probably did not hear,
and when he cut loose the machine turned turtle.</p>

<p>One of the saddest of all the many aeroplane fatalities
was the accident early in the fall of 1911, in
which Professor Montgomery was killed while experimenting
with his glider.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the pioneers whose work has
counted for the most in the early history of aviation
were Americans&mdash;that the science can almost be
claimed as a development of American genius. True,
Ader was the first man to fly in a power-propelled
machine, and Lilienthal led the way in the science
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
of gliding, but it remained for Chanute, Langley,
Montgomery, and the Wright brothers to gather all
this scientific data together and put it to practical use
so that the motor could be installed and power
flight, or dynamic flight, as the scientists call it,
begun.</p>

AEROPLANE DEVELOPMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class="hanging">HOW THE INVENTORS CARRIED ON THE ART OF AVIATION
UNTIL IT BECAME THE GREATEST OF ALL
SPORTS AND THEN A GREAT INDUSTRY</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>O INTERESTED in aviation had our young
friend become that he forgot all other
inventions in his enthusiasm for flying. He
never missed a chance to go to the aviation field,
and sometimes his scientist friend would go with
him. These days were rare treats indeed, for the
boy always learned some new and important points
from their conversations.</p>

<p>With them we have seen how the science of aeronautics
has been divided into two great departments:
balloons, or lighter-than-air fliers, and all
other machines that are not maintained in the air by
hot air or gas. We have seen also the three great divisions
of heavier-than-air aviation&mdash;that is, orthopters
or wing-flapping machines; helicopters or machines
that fly upward through the operation of horizontal
screws; and aeroplanes. Lastly we see the three
divisions of aeroplanes: gliders; dynamic aeroplanes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
or the machines we know to-day; and true bird
soaring, the art of flying without artificial power and
without the flapping of wings.</p>

<p>But on every side the boy heard people talking
of great feats of flying that he knew nothing about.</p>

<p>"Who was Santos-Dumont? What was that first
trans-Channel flight? Why do they always talk
about the first Rheims meet?" he asked one afternoon
as he was returning home from the field with
the scientist.</p>

<p>The man could not answer the questions all in
one breath, but we will follow his explanation, which
extended over many pleasant hours, and see how
aviation developed into a mighty sport and industry.</p>

<p>For several years following 1905 the world of aviation
was led by Europeans&mdash;mostly Frenchmen who
readily grasped the principles of the science and made
the best and lightest motors that the world has ever
seen. The United States, however, was the first
nation to experiment with aeroplanes for military
purposes, although at present the country is far
behind France, England, and Germany in the development
of aeroplanes for use in war.</p>

<p>Alberto Santos-Dumont, a daring young Brazilian
who a few years earlier had astounded the world with
his achievements with dirigible balloons, was the
first of the aviators working in Europe to construct
a practical man-carrying power flier. Scores of
brilliant foreigners were working on the principles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
for gliders laid down by Lilienthal, but Santos-Dumont,
working along the ideas of the scientists
who had built power-propelled models, made himself
a clumsy biplane equipped with a 50-horsepower
motor and actually inaugurated public flights,
considering that all done by the Wrights up to that
time was experimental and practically in secret.</p>

<p>On August 22, 1906, he made his first flight near
Paris. It was brief, but authorities agree that it
was the first time in Europe that a power-propelled
flier had risen in free flight with a man at the steering
wheel since Ader's secret flight in 1892. Two
months later he made a public flight of 221 metres
in 21 seconds, winning the world's first regularly
offered aviation prize. This was the Archdeacon
Cup of 2,000 francs authorized by the Aero Club
of France for a flight of 100 metres.</p>

<p>Scientists gave these flights more attention than
they did the flights of the Wright brothers the year
before because they were viewed by many thousands
of people and also by men who had studied the science
of aviation for years. Besides this, Santos-Dumont
made no secret of the construction or workings of
his machine as the Wright brothers did. He was
already a popular idol through his work with dirigible
balloons, and being very rich&mdash;the son of a millionaire
plantation owner in Brazil&mdash;he did not have
the same financial incentive for keeping his plans
secret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
His flights gave the aviators of France tremendous
encouragement and it was but a short time until
half a dozen aeroplanes, the makes of which are all
well known now, were making successful flights and
breaking records.</p>

<p>Santos-Dumont called his biplane an aeromobile.
The two main planes had perpendicular surfaces
enclosing them so that the wings of each side looked
like two box kites hitched together side by side, as
shown in the picture. The rudder extended to the
front and it also looked like a box kite. The pilot
sat just in front of the wings and could manipulate
his rudder from side to side or up and down. Thus
he could steer his machine from right to left, upward
or downward. The Brazilian had not solved the
problem of keeping his aeromobile from tipping sideways,
so he arranged its wings in a dihedral angle,
which balanced it fairly well. The starting and
alighting device was a set of wheels which we know
so well to-day. The biplane contained 65 square
feet of plane surface and the total weight was 645
pounds.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important factor in this machine
was an eight-cylinder 50-horsepower Antoinette
gasoline motor. This was the first time that this
now famous motor was used in an aeroplane and it
gave promise at that time of the prize-winning
capabilities it later developed. The propeller, which
was made of aluminum, was about six feet in diameter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
or about two feet less than the diameter of the twin
screws in the early Wright biplanes.</p>

<p>THE FIRST LETTER EVER WRITTEN ABOARD AN AEROPLANE
IN FLIGHT</p>
<p>This was written at the time Ovington was carrying aeroplane mail
from Garden City to Mineola, by aeroplane.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Several years before this the Voisin brothers had
been taken by the general fever for aviation and in
1907 they finished a practical biplane in which Henri
Farman, a former auto racer, and Leon Delagrange,
an artist, astonished the world. This early machine
is described by one authority as something like a
cross between a box kite and a Chanute glider. Extending
out behind the two main planes was a
rudder like a huge box kite, which was used to
steer the machine from right to left. This also
helped to keep the biplane from tipping forward
or backward. A single horizontal rudder in front
steered it upward or downward. These rudders were
manipulated by the operator, who sat between the
two main planes in front of his engine, by either pushing
his pilot wheel forward or backward or by turning
it like the steering wheel of an automobile. There
was no device for balancing the aeroplane, but the
construction kept it on a fairly even keel&mdash;or, as
the scientist said, it had inherent or automatic
stability&mdash;i. e., stability automatically gained from
the construction of the machine. Also the operator
was supposed to swing his body from side to side to
aid this. The aeroplane started from and alighted
on four wheels set under the main plane and the tail.
It had 559 square feet of surface and with the engine
weighed 1,100 pounds. The motor was a 50-horsepower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Antoinette, which drove a single aluminum
propeller.</p>

<p>After preliminary "bird hops" at Issy-les-Mollineaux,
Farman on October 26 beat Santos-Dumont's
record by flying 771 metres. On January 13,
1908, he won the Deutsch-Archdeacon Cup of 50,000
francs for the first person to make a circular flight of
500 metres. Two months later Delagrange challenged
Farman for his world championship, but lost, Farman
twice circling the two pylons, or marking poles, that
had been set up 500 metres apart, in 3 minutes 31
seconds. The distance covered with turns was
2004.8 metres. Delagrange flew the 500 metres in
2.5 minutes.</p>

<p>Then for the first time in the world's history two
men rode in an aeroplane, Delagrange taking his rival
behind him and sailing over a part of the course. A
month later Delagrange took the distance record from
Farman with a flight of 5,575 metres in 9-1/4 minutes.</p>

<p>While these pioneers were winning prizes and breaking
records Louis Bl√©riot was bringing his aeroplane
to a successful stage. He had been working on the
problem of aviation since 1900, but had failed with
wing flappers and machines like box kites. Finally
he had some success with a tandem monoplane like
Professor Langley's. The first of his machines of
this kind was smashed in a fall, but the second,
Bl√©riot's seventh flier, flew steadily and was the
fastest aeroplane ever developed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Thus Bl√©riot at the opening of 1908 had developed
his monoplane idea far past the stage Professor
Langley ever had developed it. He had increased
the size of the forward plane and decreased the size
of the rear plane until the great forward wings did
all the work of sustaining the machine in the air,
while the chief uses of the tail were steering and
steadying the machine. Moreover, Bl√©riot's was
the first machine among the practical European fliers
to have a system of wing warping such as the Wright
brothers had developed in their wonderful biplane,
and such as Glenn Curtiss, another American inventor,
was at the same time developing for his
machines.</p>

<p>This gave Bl√©riot what is called three-rudder
control&mdash;that is, the vertical rudder at the rear to
steer it from right to left, the horizontal rudder, also on
the tail, to steer it up or down, and the flexible wing
tips to keep it from tipping sidewise. The aspect
ratio of the early Bl√©riots was low, which gave them
greater speed. In other words, the main plane did
not have so great a spread as most aeroplanes do,
while it was much deeper, and, having less of an
entering edge, it could go faster. There were three
wheels&mdash;two under the main plane and the third
under the tail for starting and alighting. The engine
was just under and at the front of the main plane,
driving a single propeller. This propeller&mdash;which
is the type most used on monoplanes&mdash;is called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
a tractor propeller because, instead of pushing the
aeroplane forward from the rear, it pulls it from the
front. The operator sat just to the rear and above
the engine so he could look out and over the top of
the main plane.</p>

<p>The last day of October, 1908, Bl√©riot jumped into
international fame with this machine by making a
cross-country flight from Toury to Artenay, a total
distance of about 17 miles. This was the second
cross-country flight ever attempted. The day previous
Farman had flown his biplane from Ch√¢lons
to Rheims, nearly 17 miles.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Wright brothers had been making
great progress, as will be seen shortly, and Wilbur
Wright had brought a biplane to France to make
demonstrations for a French syndicate. He took
up quarters at Le Mans in August, 1908. His notable
flights broke the world's records for distance and
duration. Early in the month he flew 52 miles and
was in the air 1 hour and 31 minutes. A few days
later he broke the French records for altitude by
going up 380 feet, and on the last day of the year
won the Michelin prize of 20,000 francs for the longest
flight of the year.</p>

<p>In January Wilbur Wright went to Pau, where he
opened a school and was joined by his brother Orville,
who had just recovered from a historical accident
in the United States which will be described shortly.
At Pau they made a great many flights and exhibited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
their aeroplane to thousands and thousands of people
from all over the world, including great scientists,
military men, statesmen, and many members of the
European nobility. Among these was young King
Alfonso of Spain, who took such a delight in the
machine that he would have made an ascension
were it not for the objections of his ministers. King
Edward of England also visited the famous brothers,
talked with them about their achievements, and witnessed
several fine flights. Then Wilbur took his
machine to Italy, where King Emanuel attended his
exhibitions in Rome. Later in London the two
brothers were entertained by the Aeronautical
Society of Great Britain and received its gold medal.
During this time they won the respect of the whole
world of aviation.</p>

<p>"Now to return to the progress made by the
intrepid American inventors in our own country,
led by the Wright brothers, Glenn Curtiss, A. M.
Herring, Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, and his associates,
F. W. Baldwin and J. A. D. McCurdy," continued
the boy's friend.</p>

<p>"You remember that toward the close of 1905
the Wright brothers suspended their flights near
Dayton because it had become necessary for them to
spend all their time in business negotiations. In the
spring of 1908, after increasing the motor power of
their flier, they began tests again because the brothers
had agreed to furnish a machine to the United
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
States Signal Corps and another to a French syndicate."</p>

<p>The machine that was to be furnished to the Signal
Corps, he explained, had to be able to carry two men
and to be able to fly for one hour without stopping,
at an average speed of 40 miles an hour. Furthermore,
this flight had to be made across country dotted
with hills, valleys, and forests. Another of the requirements
was that the machine should be able
to fly 125 miles without stopping. The Wright
brothers agreed to furnish such an aeroplane for
$25,000, and Orville Wright went to Fort Myer,
Va., near Washington, for the tests.</p>

<p>His preliminary flights were very successful and
thousands of Americans flocked to the drill ground
to see what was practically the first public exhibition
in the United States. About the time that the
French aviators were making flights of 1 hour or
so Orville Wright flew his machine for one hour and
3 minutes. Repeatedly he took Lieut. Frank P.
Lahm or Lieutenant Selfridge for short flights.</p>

<p>On the 17th of September the tragic accident that
put a stop to the flights occurred. Orville Wright
was flying about 75 feet high with Lieutenant Selfridge
as a passenger when one of the propellers hit a stay
wire which coiled about the blade, breaking it and
making the machine unmanageable. The aeroplane
plunged to the ground, throwing the occupants
forward. Lieutenant Selfridge suffered injuries from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
which he died within three hours, while Wright
suffered several broken bones. This occurred while
Wilbur Wright was at Le Mans, France.</p>

<p>The year before Dr. Alexander Graham Bell,
the American inventor, had invited Glenn Curtiss,
a bicycle and motor manufacturer, to aid him in
equipping with power the fliers that he was constructing
with the help of Lieutenant Selfridge, F. W.
Baldwin, and J. A. D. McCurdy. They formed the
Aerial Experiment Association, which later became
famous, and early in March, 1908, began the test of
their first aeroplane, which they called the <i>Red
Wing</i>. The machine was tried over the ice of
Lake Keuka, near Hammondsport, N. Y., and before
its makers were ready to fly it went into the air and
sailed 300 feet. The <i>Red Wing</i> was of biplane type
and mounted on skids, with the propeller and vertical
direction rudder at the rear. The horizontal elevating
rudder was at the front. The notable feature was
the curve of the planes. The upper plane curved
from the centre downward, while the lower plane
curved from the centre upward, so that the two
planes, if they had been a little bit longer, would have
met. This curvature was expected to give automatic
stability, but the machine was never a great success.</p>

<p>The next machine made by these experimenters
was called the <i>White Wing</i>, and made some fair
flights. The next was the famous <i>June Bug</i> which
was designed by Curtiss and entered by him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
contest for the <i>Scientific American</i> Cup for a flight
of one kilometre. The test, which was held on the
4th of July, 1908, near Hammondsport, was the first
official flight for a prize in America, and was successful
in every way, winning the cup with a flight of
200 yards. This biplane had the three-rudder control&mdash;that
is, a tail at the rear shaped like a box kite
to steer it from right to left, two small parallel planes
in front to steer it up or down, and a system of flexible
wing tips which enabled the operator to maintain
a side to side balance.</p>

<p>In 1909 Curtiss made some important improvements
over his machine of previous years by replacing
the flexible wing tips with ailerons. This was the
first time these devices were used in this country,
but they had already been introduced in Europe on
several machines. There are many kinds of ailerons,
but on Curtiss's biplane they were two small horizontal
planes fixed between the outer tips of the upper and
lower planes. They could be turned so as to keep the
aeroplane balanced when making a sharp turn or
when struck by a gust of wind.</p>

<p>Curtiss and his partner, A. M. Herring, took the
machine to the plains near Mineola, L. I., that summer,
and began preliminary flights. They won
several rich prizes, including that year's <i>Scientific
American</i> Cup for the longest flight of the season.
In this Curtiss made an official distance of 24-1/2
miles.</p>

We will leave Mr. Curtiss and his associates for the
time being and take up again the work of the Wright
brothers, who in the spring of 1909 returned to the
United States after their European triumphs. Their
laurels were further added to by a medal from the
Aero Club of America, presented by President Taft
at the White House, and medals from the Federal
Government, the state of Ohio, and their home town
of Dayton. All this time they were busy making
the aeroplane with which they were to resume the
final tests for the Government that had been interrupted
the previous fall by the death of Lieutenant
Selfridge. They arrived at Fort Myer in June, but
spent most of that month and a large part of July
in preparations and short practice flights. The
great crowds, among which were scores of statesmen
and politicians, gathered in Washington, became
impatient at the delays, but the brothers had waited
for a good many years to perfect their biplane and
would not risk failure by attempting the official
tests in bad weather, with their plane out of tune,
or their engine in bad working order.</p>

<p>Finally ten thousand cheering spectators were
rewarded by seeing Orville Wright ascend with
Lieutenant Lahm as a passenger, and sail for 1
hour and 40 seconds, fulfilling the endurance requirements.
The next few days the weather prevented
the distance test, but one calm evening just
before sunset Orville carried Lieut. B. D. Foulois
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
across hills and valleys to Alexandria and return at
an average speed of 42.6 miles per hour. This won
the brothers a bonus of $5,000 on the price of the
machine because they were to receive $2,500 extra
for each mile per hour more than the 40 miles per
hour called for in the contract. It was the greatest
feat of aviation ever seen in the United States at
the time and the ovation tendered the brothers was
equal to the occasion. Not once, however, did they
lose their heads in the slightest or show any undue
enthusiasm over their achievement. Statesmen, army
officers, and newspaper men crowded around with
congratulations and praises, but the great victory
was only what the brothers had expected and they
soon were planning improvements on their biplane.</p>

<p>The real meaning of this feat by the Wright biplane,
however, was that the United States was the first
nation officially to adopt an aeroplane for military
purposes. To Americans it seems peculiarly fitting
that it was the Wright machine that was adopted
because it was the Wright aeroplane, strictly an
American product, that was the first practical flier.</p>

<p>Later on Wilbur returned to Fort Myer to finish
off his contract by teaching two Signal Corps officers
to handle the machine. During this time the aviator
changed his biplane by transferring one of the forward
elevating planes to the rear, where it was used
as a fixed tail to give greater stability from front to
rear. This was such a success that it was used in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
subsequent models, and the present-day Wright
biplanes have no forward lifting plane at all&mdash;the
horizontal plane at the rear serving as the elevator
and also as the fore and aft balancer.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1909, after the Fort Myer tests, the
brothers again separated, Orville going to Europe,
where he achieved more distinction, and Wilbur remaining
at home to astonish his countrymen with
his exhibitions at the Hudson-Fulton Celebration.
He made the first trip around the Statue of Liberty
on September 9, starting from and returning to
Governor's Island in New York Bay.</p>

<p>In the meantime the European aviators were
making even greater strides, and 1909 saw many new
aeroplanes take the air to break records of different
kinds. Throughout the season there was hardly
a day that some record was not broken, or that some
previously unknown man did not achieve undying
fame for his daring feats.</p>

<p>Aeroplane schools were established and aviation
passed from the stage of experimenting into the stage
of record making and breaking.</p>

<p>The European governments, particularly France
and Germany, were carefully watching progress, and
dozens of the pupils in the aviation schools were
young officers detailed to learn the art of flying and
report on its usefulness in warfare. Also the building
of aeroplanes became a great industry and in France
thousands of scientists, designers, mechanics, motor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
experts, and wood-working experts were engaged in
turning out machines as fast as they could.</p>

<p>It would be impossible in this brief space to
describe all of the important flights of the last few
busy years in aviation, which were talked of by
the boy and his scientist friend, but a very brief
outline of the feats accomplished will show the wonderful
progress that has been made. The first great
international meet, which was held at Rheims, France,
in 1909, did more than anything else up to that time
to show the world how far the science had gone
and how many good machines there were. So great
was the public interest in this meet that before the
end of the year meets were arranged and held at
Blackpool and Donchester, England; Berlin, Juvisy,
France, and Brescia, Italy. The most notable achievements
of the year in Europe were the flight across
the English Channel by Bl√©riot in his graceful monoplane,
by which he won the prize of 1,000 pounds
offered by the London <i>Daily Mail</i>, the winning of
the James Gordon Bennett Cup by Curtiss, the only
American to contest for the great honour, and the
winning of the Grand Prix by Farman in his biplane.
Bl√©riot, while practising, before his famous flight
across the English Channel, broke many records with
his monoplanes, No. XI and No. XII. He was the
first man to take two passengers in such a craft, those
in the machine besides himself being Santos-Dumont
and A. Fournier. The total weight of machine and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
three men was 1,232 pounds. He also made several
cross-country records and received medals from the
Aero Club of Great Britain and the Aero Club of
France.</p>

<p>Bl√©riot's flight over the English Channel was one
of the most dramatic that ever has been made by
an aviator, as he encountered perils that no birdman
ever before had faced. He had as a contestant one
of the daring young aviators who has made the
history of aviation read like a novel. This was
Hubert Latham, who used the Antoinette monoplane,
one of the most beautiful machines ever designed,
and which is described fully later on. Young Latham
had become a popular hero because of his daring
feats. The aviators said that he was carrying on an
endless battle with the wind, for he seemed to prefer
flying high in the air when the wind was so gusty
that other aviators were afraid to leave their hangars.
He had made several monoplane records for endurance
and altitude, and after a notable cross-country
flight announced his intention of sailing across the
English Channel to collect the 1,000 pounds from the
<i>Daily Mail</i>. So he took his graceful monoplane to
Calais, and after impatiently waiting for fair weather,
soared from the towering cliffs and out over the
stormy waters of the English Channel. Thousands
cheered his daring and wished him success, but before
he had gone more than six miles his motor failed him
and he glided to the water. In a few minutes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
boat that was sailing below him came up and found
him calmly sitting on the upper framework of his
machine, which was buoyed up by the great wings.
He was looking as unconcerned as if he had been
sitting in a motor boat on a lake, and declared he
would try again the next day. His machine was
wrecked in getting it ashore, however, and Bl√©riot
made his famous flight before the young man could
get it repaired.</p>

<p>The older man had been injured in an accident and
was still walking on crutches, with a badly burned
foot, when a favourable opportunity for the trans-channel
flight came. He was awakened before dawn
on the morning of July 25th, and, throwing away his
crutches as he got into his machine for a practise
spin, he said: "I will show the world that I can fly
even if I cannot walk."</p>

<p>At 4:35, just as the sun was rising, he sailed out
over the precipice, and Latham, watching him, wept
with disappointment at not being able to enter the
contest. A torpedo boat destroyer was following
him, but soon she dropped behind and he was over
the trackless channel without any landmark to
guide him. Finally the coast of France dropped out
of sight and the intrepid aviator was alone, with
nothing but his carefully planned monoplane between
him and death in the tossing waters hundreds of
feet below.</p>

<p>After ten minutes of this the cliffs of the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
coast loomed up ahead, bathed in the early morning
sunlight. He saw several boats far below him and
followed their course, which brought him to the town
of Deal, near which he landed. The first man to
greet him was his good friend M. Montaine, but soon
after a crowd of Englishmen were crowding about
congratulating him on his wonderful achievement.
Not to be outdone, young Latham cabled his congratulations.</p>

<p>August saw the beginning of the first great international
meet at Rheims. Most of the leading
aviators of the world gathered there to contest for
the prizes and for fame. Curtiss, Bl√©riot, Farman,
Latham, Lefabre, Count de Lambert, Paul Tissandier,
Louis Paulhan, Le Blanc, Roger Sommer, and
Rougier all distinguished themselves and made their
names as familiar in this country as they were in
France.</p>

<p>Latham, with his apparently fearless disregard
of danger, and his great, soaring Antoinette monoplane
that looked more like a dragon-fly when up in
the air than anything else, was one of the popular
idols. Not only did he fly in rough winds but also
in heavy rainfall, as did his rival, Bl√©riot. Of course
there were several bad accidents, but none to compare
with the later fatalities.</p>

<p>The winning of the $10,000 Grand Prix de la
Champagne for the longest flight was not so spectacular
as the next day's great race. Latham had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
made a record of 96 miles that it was thought would
stand. On the day of the finals, Friday, August
27th, Latham again took the air, making a
spectacular flight several hundred feet high. At the
same time several others were performing evolutions
in the air, some high and some low. Farman was
flying close to the ground and making but poor time
in his slower craft. Finally, after all the others had
come to earth, the longest flight having been made
by Latham, with 68 miles to his credit, the crowd
realized that Farman was making a record. Time
after time he passed the grand stand, marking
off the miles. It became dark, but the crowd still
lingered, and was rewarded finally by seeing him
bring his machine softly to the ground in front of the
judges' stand, winner of the $10,000, with a record
of 190 kilometres. His friends, wild with joy, pulled
the exhausted aviator from his seat and carried him
off the field on their shoulders.</p>

<p>The next day Curtiss, the only American taking
part in the meet (although several Wright biplanes
were flown by Frenchmen), brought out his 60-horsepower
biplane to try for the speed prize of $5,000
offered by James Gordon Bennett. He made two
rounds of the field at a speed of 47.04 miles an hour.
Bl√©riot then brought out his great 80-horsepower
monoplane, but the test flights were discouraging.
Finally, after working over his machine all afternoon
and trying several propellers, he started at five o'clock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
and made his first round in much better time than
Curtiss had done. He slackened up on the second
round, however, and came to earth to find that he
had lost to the gallant American. By winning the
prize Curtiss was allowed to take the next year's
contest to his own country.</p>

<p>There were many other records broken at the
other meets held in 1909, but none of them stood
long after the 1910 season had got well under way.
Altitude, endurance, distance and speed records
all were shattered by the ever-increasing army of
aviators and the constantly improving machines.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the most spectacular and daring feat of
1910 was the flight across the Alps by George Chavez,
who was born in Paris of Peruvian parents only
twenty-three years before his tragic death. In September
of that year he set out to win the prize of 70,000
francs offered by the Italian Aviation Society to the
first aviator who would fly the 75 miles from Brig
to Milan, across the towering peaks and yawning
chasms of the Alps. Of the five who entered the
contest Chavez was the only one to make a real
start. After waiting for several days, during which
wind, rain and fog kept him chained to the ground,
he finally rose in the air.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he was 7,000 feet above sea level,
crossing the famous Simplon Pass, braving the fierce
eddies of wind that swirled around the cruel, jagged
crags and precipices. Finally he crossed the mountains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
and glided down the Italian slope to Domodossola.
Thousands had gathered to greet his arrival,
but as he was sinking gradually to the earth, only
thirty feet above the ground, a gust of wind caught the
machine, the wings collapsed and the brave young
man fell to earth underneath the machinery. He received
injuries from which he died four days later.
The committee granted him one third of the prize
on the basis that he had completed the difficult part
of the journey.</p>

<p>No less dangerous was Glenn Curtiss's trip from
Albany to New York in his biplane, by which he won
the $10,000 prize offered by the New York <i>World</i>.
Most of his route lay over wooded hills, the waters
of the Hudson River, or the cliffs along its banks,
which territory, as any one who has travelled from
New York to Albany knows, offers few landing places.
Starting with a letter from the Mayor of Albany to
the Mayor of New York and followed by a special
train on the New York Central he made Camelot,
41 miles from Albany, in about an hour. The next
jump was clear to Spuyten Duyvil, the northern
boundary of Manhattan, which completed the required
128 miles in a total elapsed time of 2 hours
and 32 minutes. His average speed was 50-1/2 miles
an hour.</p>

<p>This stage of the journey nearly brought serious
disaster to the aviator, for, while passing the famous
old mountain Storm King, he was caught by a terrific
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
gust of wind and his machine was twisted sideways so
that it dropped suddenly toward the river. By
skilful manipulation he righted his biplane and
continued.</p>

<p>After a brief pause at Spuyten Duyvil he sailed
down the Hudson River and the upper New York
Bay to Governor's Island. Every whistle in the
harbour, a few million people and the reporters
representing the newspaper readers of the whole
civilized world, proclaimed his victory over the wind
gusts eddying around the palisades and the New York
skyscrapers.</p>

<p>In the United States there were many aviators
besides Curtiss who were making an effort to win
long distance prizes. The New York <i>Times</i> and
the Philadelphia <i>Ledger</i> had offered a large purse,
supposed to be $10,000, for the first flight from New
York to Philadelphia, and on June 13th, a few days
after Glenn Curtiss's flight from Albany to New York,
Charles K. Hamilton, another young man new to
aviation, sailed in his Curtiss biplane the 86 miles
from Governor's Island to Philadelphia in 1 hour
and 43 minutes, and returned the same day.
His average speed was 50-1/2 miles an hour, the
same maintained by Curtiss in his Albany-New
York trip. These two flights added tremendously
to the fame of the Curtiss machines.</p>

<p>The great International Aviation Tournament of
1910, held at Belmont Park in October, was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
climax of the season in this country. Of course
interest centred around the race for the James
Gordon Bennett Cup and prize of $5,000, which
had been won the year before at Rheims by Curtiss.
The total prizes amounted to $60,000 and practically
every standard make of aeroplane was represented.
The American aviators came into prominence at
this meet, as will be remembered by the feats of
Walter Brookins, Arch. Hoxsey, Ralph Johnstone,
J. A. Drexel and a dozen others. The English contingent
was led by Claude Grahame-White, who
had been making himself famous at the Harvard-Boston
meet. Of the Frenchmen, Alfred LeBlanc,
Hubert Latham, Emiel Aubrun and Count de
Lesseps were among the leaders.</p>

<p>Nearly every one nowadays is familiar with the story
of how Grahame-White brought out his 100-horsepower
Bl√©riot monoplane for its first trial and made
100 kilometres at an average speed of 61 miles an
hour. Soon after that LeBlanc came out with another
100-horsepower Bl√©riot, acknowledged to be one of
the swiftest machines ever made at that time, and
started on a race around the course at a speed such
as the world had never seen before. In the last lap
his gasoline gave out, the aeroplane shot downward
and was smashed against a telephone pole. LeBlanc
was more angry than injured, because he had
lost the race, although his speed had been 67 miles
an hour, or six miles better than Grahame-White's.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Brookins, with the Wright biplane racing machine,
started out with high speed, but the engine
soon began to miss fire and he too came to earth.
Consequently Grahame-White carried off the
prize.</p>

<p>The next day the aviators were out to contest
for the $10,000 offered by Thomas F. Ryan for the
quickest flight from the aviation field to the Statue
of Liberty in New York Harbour, 16 miles away, and
return. Never before was there such a dramatic
race. Together Count de Lesseps and Claude
Grahame-White, both in Bl√©riot machines, started
for the Statue. John Moisant, the American aviator,
who only that summer had made the first flight from
Paris to London, suddenly determined to win the
prize. It took him about five minutes to buy LeBlanc's
50-horsepower Bl√©riot monoplane for $10,000,
and just as Grahame-White and de Lesseps were
returning from their flight Moisant started out. Instead
of taking the safer roundabout course, where
there were many landing places, this dauntless
birdman sailed directly over the church steeples
of Brooklyn, cutting through the treacherous air
currents at terrific speed, circling the Statue at great
altitude and returning by the same route. His time
was 43 seconds better than that of Grahame-White,
who flew a machine of double the power. The
Americans were wild with delight, thinking Moisant
had won the prize, but the committee finally gave the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
award to Count de Lesseps, who made the slowest
time, because Grahame-White had fouled the starting
post, or pylon, as it is called by aviators, and because
Moisant in his desperation to get started had failed
to qualify.</p>

<p>But there were other records broken. Ralph
Johnstone, flying the small Wright biplane racer,
which was equipped with particularly large propellers,
broke the altitude record of 9,104 feet which
had been set in France by climbing to an altitude of
9,714 feet. The round trip to and from the clouds
took him 1 hour and 43 minutes. In connection
with the altitude trials, the daring of Johnstone
and Hoxsey was particularly notable. Both of
these aviators took up their Wright biplanes when the
wind was blowing so fiercely that they could hardly
turn the pylons. When they got to a great altitude,
one time the gale was so terrific that they were
carried backward at a speed of nearly 40 miles
an hour, and both of them had to land in open country;
Johnstone at Holtsville, L. I., 55 miles away,
and Hoxsey at Brentwood, half that distance. During
these flights both of them had reached altitudes
of more than a mile in the air. But these records
were not destined to stand long, as will be shown
by the table on page <a href="#Page_75">75</a>.</p>

<p>But world's distance and altitude records were being
broken in Europe, too, and during the summer of
1910 the record keepers were busy putting new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
names at the heads of their lists, as will be shown
by the table on page <a href="#Page_76">76</a>. The long distance speed
race, called the "Circuit de l'Est," which took in
a course 488 miles long, of six towns around Paris,
aroused as much enthusiasm as any. The prize
which was offered by the newspaper <i>Le Matin</i>
of Paris was for 100,000 francs. The race started
on August 7, with eight contestants, and ended on
August 17 with Alfred LeBlanc, in his Bl√©riot
monoplane, the winner. He had made the distance
in six stages at an average speed of 40 miles
an hour, flying through rain, fog and wind. Next
came Aubrun in a Bl√©riot and Weyman in a Farman.
Not only was this race one of the severest
tests that the aeroplane had ever had, but also it
was a trial to the aviators that did a great deal to
prove the practicability of the aeroplanes for more
serious work than pleasant day sport.</p>

<p>Then, too, there was the great London to Manchester
race for the $50,000 offered by Lord Northcliffe,
owner of the London <i>Daily Mail</i>. This was one of the
most exciting contests of the year, not only because
of the difficulties of the trip, but also because of the
nip and tuck finish between the two contestants.</p>

<p>Claude Grahame-White had just purchased a Farman
biplane, and hearing that Paulhan was hurrying
across the Atlantic from the United States
to try for the prize himself, the Englishman announced
that he would start as soon as his machine
could be set up. He had had but little experience
with the biplane, as always before that time he had
used a Bl√©riot, but nevertheless, in spite of the advice
of his friends to wait, Grahame-White started on the
183-mile flight on the morning of April 23d in the
teeth of a high wind. According to Grahame-White's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
own account of the flight he was buffeted about so
unmercifully by the wind that several times he thought
he would have to descend. At the same time the
cold was so intense that he suffered agonies. He
reached his first stop at Rugby in safety, though so
cold he had to be lifted from his seat, but soon after
taking the air again the gale rose to such a pitch that
he was forced to land. He went to a hotel to rest and
wait for the wind to abate, but while there the gale
tipped over his biplane, smashing it so badly that the
aviator had to give up and take his machine back
to London practically to be rebuilt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Paulhan had reached England and
was rushing his workmen night and day to get his
aeroplane set up before Grahame-White could complete
his repairs and make a fresh start.</p>

<p>Finally, with the wind still blowing a gale, Paulhan
started for Manchester. Grahame-White heard
of this at 6:30 in the evening, but manfully started
after his competitor and flew 60 miles, when he
was finally forced to land in the dark. Determined
to remain in the race, he started again about three
o'clock in the morning with the intention of trying
to catch up with the daring Frenchman. Besides
the bitter cold, it was so dark that the Englishman
could not see whether he was flying high or low or
even toward Manchester. The danger of this kind
of flying he knew was very great, because if his
engine failed him he would have had to come to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
earth anywhere he happened to light, as likely on
a church steeple or in a lake as on a level spot. Of
this famous flight Grahame-White wrote in his book,
"The Story of the Aeroplane":</p>

<p>"My start was really something in the nature of
a confused jumble. Faint lights swept away on
either side as my machine moved across the ground.
I could not judge my ascent at all, on account of
the darkness. But I elevated as quickly as possible,
and got away from the ground smartly.</p>

<p>"Directly I was at a respectable height, I could see
the lights of the railway station very distinctly.
I headed toward them. Looking directly down, I
found that I could distinguish nothing on the ground
below me. It was all a black smudge. I flew right
over the lights of the railway station&mdash;and as I was
doing so my engine began to miss fire. It was
certainly a very uncomfortable moment&mdash;one of
the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced.</p>

<p>"But, very fortunately for me, after a momentary
spluttering, the engine picked up again, and fired
properly. I had begun to sink toward the ground,
upon which I knew I could have picked out no
landing place in the darkness. As soon as my engine
began to do its work again, however, I rose and continued
my flight smoothly."</p>

<p>With the dawn came a terrific wind which forced
the aviator to land near Polesworth. While waiting
for the wind to abate the Englishman and his friends
heard Paulhan had reached Manchester and won the
prize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Of Paulhan's famous flight, one of the men who
was aboard the special train following Paulhan,
according to Mr. Grahame-White, said:</p>

<p>"I do not think I have ever seen a machine roll
about in the air as his did. He was, we could see,
incessantly at work. One wind gust after another
struck the machine and it literally reeled under the
shock.</p>

<p>"Up and down it went, and from side to side.
Paulhan's pluck and determination were remarkable.
I do not think that any other man could have kept
on with such determination as he displayed. It was
a strange thing to see how the wind got worse and
worse as the airman flew on."</p>

<p>But these feats that startled the world in 1910
would not cause a ripple of enthusiasm now, since
the North American Continent has been crossed by
aeroplane; since the trip from Boston to Washington
and from St. Louis to New York has been made;
since a machine has stayed in the air a whole day,
or more than eight and a half hours, since a dozen
passengers have been carried half a dozen miles and
since the development of the hydro-aeroplane.</p>

<p>THE LATE CALBRAITH P. RODGERS, TRANS-CONTINENTAL FLIER</p>
<p>This picture was taken just after Rodgers had picked himself up after one of the many smash-ups of his aeroplane
during his ocean to ocean flight.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Of course it hasn't all been the winning of prizes
and the cheering of crowds, for, as we all know, there
has been a tragic side to aviation. Up to the
summer of 1912 more than 150 persons had met
death in aeroplane accidents. To analyze all these
accidents would require a whole book, but experts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
agree that in a great many cases they were the result
of carelessness on the part of the pilot. Of
course there were other causes, such as the collapse
of the wings, the breaking of stays, the overturning
by wind gusts, "holes in the air," the explosion
of the motor, the failure of the motor at
a critical time, or the collapse of the aviator, but
authorities declare that many of these can be prevented
by the use of proper care by the designers,
manufacturers, and pilots of the air vehicles.</p>

<p>Two of the most tragic of the recent air fatalities
were the deaths of Arch. Hoxsey and Rodgers at
Los Angeles, the former in December, 1910, and the
latter in April, 1912. Hoxsey had just set a world's
record for altitude in his Wright biplane, while
Rodgers only a few months before his death had completed
a transcontinental flight and made a world's
record.</p>

<p>Several women aviators also were killed in 1912,
including Miss Harriet Quimby, one of the first
American women to take up flying. Miss Quimby's
machine fell with her in Boston while she was making
an exhibition flight.</p>

<p>The 1911 death roll of American aviators included:
Lieutenant Kelly, U. S. A.; A. Hartle, Los Angeles;
Kreamer, Badger and Johnstone, Chicago; Frisbie,
Norton, Kan.; Castellana, Mansfield, Pa.; Miller,
Troy, Ohio; Clarke, Garden City, N. Y.; Dixon,
Spokane, Wash.; Ely, Macon, Ga.; and Professor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Montgomery, Santa Clara, Cal., whose early experiments
are held in such high esteem by scientists.</p>

<p>Just as 1910 was the year for record-breaking
aeroplane contests, 1911 was the year that proved
the aeroplane a machine with a greater and more important
use than that of a very exciting and a very
expensive sport. Probably the most astounding developments
in the world of aviation in 1911 were
the experiments of the Wright brothers at Kitty
Hawk, which showed that man has come very near
to solving the problem of true soaring flight. We will
look more closely at the experiments in a later chapter.</p>

<p>Of much greater practical use was the development
of the hydro-aeroplane by Glenn Curtiss.
His lead in this was quickly followed by the Wrights
and most of the European makers.</p>

<p>The year 1911 saw the aeroplane employed for the
first time in the world's history in actual warfare.
When the revolution was raging in Mexico in
February, 1911, the Diaz Army sent Rene Simon in a
Bl√©riot monoplane to make a scouting trip over the
camp of the insurrectos. A little later on Lieutenant
Foulois of the American Signal Service, whose name
will be remembered in connection with the Fort Myer
experiments, sailed over and about the camp of the
mobilized American Army at San Antonio, Texas,
while the Mexican revolution was in progress just
across the American boundary line.</p>

<p>Next came the use of the aeroplane for scouting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
by the Italian Army in its invasion of Tripoli.
All of these expeditions showed that the aeroplane
can be used more successfully in war for scouting than
as a means for dropping explosives. Of course there
have been many experiments conducted by aviators in
dropping paper bombs, but army officers both in the
United States and abroad are not agreed as to the
success of such projects.</p>

<p>Another of the important military experiments
has been the equipping of aeroplanes with wireless
apparatus so that a wireless operator in the machine
with the aviator could send and receive brief messages
such as would describe the position and strength
of an enemy in war time. Also many aviators have
taken up with them photographers who have taken
accurate photographs of both the still and motion
variety of the country over which they were passing.
Of course the armies of the world are building guns
which will carry to a great altitude as a defence
from aerial attack.</p>

<p>Although the first country to adopt aeroplanes for
use by its army, the United States is now far behind
other nations in its aviation squads. The United
States Signal Corps owns only a few Wright and
Curtiss biplanes, with only a small number of officers
who know how to fly them. France has an extensive
fleet of several hundred aeroplanes and a small army
of aviators, while Germany has established a school
for aviation where sixty or seventy officers are always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
being instructed in flying the various types of
machines. The German Army has now more than
one hundred aeroplanes, besides many dirigible
balloons. The British Government has not gone so
far, but has conducted some interesting experiments in
which Claude Grahame-White was one of the leaders.</p>

<p>The latest things in the aeroplane, however, are
always expected to be brought out at the French
Army tests, and several machines that were first
exhibited in this way will be described a little later
on.</p>

<p>But not only in war is the aeroplane being developed,
but also in the greater work of peace, because
the aeroplane enthusiasts expect that in the
near future the art will be developed to such a degree
of safety that regular systems of passenger traffic
can be installed. Besides this, the aeroplane is the
fastest mode of travelling now known, and it may be
used for the carrying of mail. It was only in the
summer of 1911 that the first aeroplane mail route
of the United States was established between
the aviation field in Garden City, L. I., and
the United States post-office at Mineola, several
miles away. Daily throughout the meet at Garden
City Captain Beck and Earle L. Ovington carried
a sack of officially stamped and sealed mail from the
post-office on the field to the postal station at
Mineola. The first sack was handed to Beck by Postmaster-General
Hitchcock. Before this, mail had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
been carried by aeroplane in England, but not on a
regularly established route.</p>

<p>Also the aeroplane has been pressed into service
by deputy sheriffs seeking criminals and by searching
parties hunting for lost persons. The former was
done in Los Angeles when a gang of desperadoes
escaped into the California desert and an aeroplane
soared over the sagebrush in an effort to locate them,
while the latter was done near New York after duck
hunters had got lost in a storm on great South Bay,
and near New Orleans when an aviation student
skimmed over Lake Pontchartrain and located the
body of a man drowned there.</p>

<p>These are some of the useful developments of the
aeroplane. Of course there have been many spectacular
achievements such as the trip of Calbraith
P. Rodgers, a comparatively inexperienced aviator,
from Sheepshead Bay, N. Y., to Long Beach, Cal.,
across the whole American continent; the trips of
Harry N. Atwood from Boston to Washington and
from St. Louis to New York via Chicago, Buffalo and
Albany; the trip of Vedrines from Paris to Madrid,
across the Pyrenees Mountains, and the terrific speed
of about 155 miles an hour, or more than two and a
half miles a minute, maintained by Vedrines for
eighty miles. Just to think of such a speed would
take the ordinary person's breath away, but the
aviators speak of it calmly and say it won't be long
before it will be a common thing for aeroplanes to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
make a speed of 200 miles an hour, about twice
as fast as the fastest automobile has ever burned
up the road. Then, too, there was the winning of
the James Gordon Bennett Cup and prize in England
by C. F. Weyman, an American who flew a Nieuport
monoplane equipped with a 100-horsepower
Gnome motor. It would be impossible in our
space to give a list of the contests, races, circuit
races and endurance tests of the year. Not only were
aeroplanes seen in the United States, but they were
flown in South America, Africa, Australia, Japan, India
and China. The Sphinx in the Great Sahara
Desert, the Panama Canal, Niagara Falls, the Chinese
Wall, the Far Eastern temples to Buddha, and the
Islands of the Antipodes all have been circled by the
dauntless birdmen, as well as the Goddess of Liberty
in New York and the Eiffel Tower in Paris.</p>

<p>Young Atwood started from Boston without much
ado on June 30, 1911, sailed 93 miles to New London,
Conn., and the day following reeled off the 112 miles
to New York as easily as he would walk across the
street. The Fourth of July he went to Atlantic City;
July 10th he sailed from there to Baltimore, a distance
of 122 miles, which was made in four hours and
a half; and the day after that finished up by sailing
into Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>This young aviator still was not satisfied and
shipped his aeroplane to St. Louis, from where on
August 14th he started for New York. His longest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
single flight was made from St. Louis to Chicago, 283
miles in 6 hours and 32 minutes. Flying an average
distance of 105-1/2 miles a day for the remaining
eleven days, he completed the 1,266 miles on
August 25th. His total flying time was 28 hours
and 53 minutes, and his average speed 43.9 miles
per hour.</p>

<p>Far more exciting was the record-breaking flight
of the ill-fated Rodgers from the Atlantic to the
Pacific. He had a number of severe falls, but his
determination carried him through in spite of everything.
His machine was a specially constructed
Wright biplane model Ex, something of a mixture
between the regular racing and passenger carrying
types. Starting from Sheepshead Bay, N. Y.,
on September 17th, the young giant, who had only
learned to fly that summer, was off on the longest trip
ever attempted by a birdman. After being on the go
for forty-nine days, he sailed over the coast towns
to Long Beach on the Pacific Ocean. He was actually
in the air the equivalent of 3 days, 10 hours,
4 minutes; made an average speed of 51 miles
an hour, and his longest single flight was from
Sanderson to Sierra Blanca, Texas, on October 28th,
a distance of 231 miles. He crossed three ranges of
mountains, two deserts and the continental plain;
he wrecked and rebuilt his machine four times
and replaced some parts of it eight times; he rode
through darkness and wind and rain and lightning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
at the heart of a thunder cloud. Once his engine
blew up while he was 4,000 feet high and he had
to glide to earth. A special train with duplicate
parts, a complete repair-shop, and mechanics followed
as he winged his way up the Hudson across
New York State, across the plains of the Middle
West, down through Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas,
across the Arizona and California deserts, over the
Pacific range, and finally to the western ocean.
His worst accident came at Compton, Cal., on the
last stage of his journey, when he was so badly
injured that he was laid up twenty-eight days.
This occurred on November 12th, but, persevering to
the end, Rodgers arose as soon as he was able and
sailed to the ocean on December 10th.</p>

<p>Rodgers remained in California the rest of the
winter, giving many exhibitions of his daring and
skill, only to meet his death while holding the world's
record. On April 3, 1912, while 7,000 persons at
Long Beach, near Los Angeles, watched his evolutions,
his machine tipped forward. The crowd
cheered, thinking it a daring dive, but became silent
when they saw the aviator had lost control. From
a height of 200 feet the biplane plunged into the
surf where the water was only two feet deep. When
the people reached the broken machine Rodgers was
dead&mdash;his neck broken. There was nothing to
show the cause of the biplane's dive. The spot where
Rodgers was killed is only a few yards from the one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
where he completed his transcontinental flight, and
where the citizens of Los Angeles planned to erect
a monument to his achievement.</p>

<p>Most boys are perfectly familiar with the important
events of 1912 in aviation, which the scientist and
his young friend talked over so eagerly, for, of course,
the papers are full of them, and aviation meets
are a common thing now in nearly every city of the
country.</p>

<p>The development of the hydro-aeroplane was
probably the chief work of the inventors for the
year, but with it came many devices designed to
prevent the appalling loss of life while the art of
flying is being perfected. One of them is a parachute
fixed to the top of the plane, which the aviator
is supposed to open in case his machine gets beyond
control. In tests aviators have descended to earth
in these parachutes without injury. Also a number
of automatic balancing and stabilizing devices have
been brought out.</p>

<p>Frank Coffyn's feats in and about New York
Bay during the winter of 1912 with his Wright hydro-aeroplane
gave that city the best idea of the success
of the aeroplane in and over water it had ever had.
He flew from and alighted on the water and great
ice floes in the bay as easily as aviators would fly
from a clear landing ground on a calm day. It was
from Coffyn's machine that the picture of the Statue
of Liberty was taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
The world saw the first hydro-aeroplane meet in
March of 1911 off the coast of the little European
principality of Monaco. Seven aviators competed
for the rich prizes, and, although the Maurice Farman
machine won the greatest number of points, the
Curtiss hydros showed the greatest speed, and
alighted with perfect ease in breakers four feet high.</p>

<p>Far more important than the winning of prize contests
is the latest achievement of Glen Curtiss in perfecting
his "flying boat," pictures of which are shown
opposite page <a href="#Page_23">23</a>. Curtiss describes this aeroplane
as a combination between a speed motor boat, a yacht
and a flying machine. Speaking of the new plane, he
said recently: "With this craft the dangers common to
land aeroplanes are eliminated and safe flying is here.
It will develop a new and popular sport which will be
known as aerial yachting." The most important factor
in this machine is its safety, but it also is speedy,
for in its official tests at Hammondsport it developed
50 miles an hour as a motor boat and 60 miles an
hour as an aeroplane. The boat is 26 feet long and 3
feet wide. The planes are 30 feet wide and 5-1/2 feet
deep. The rudders are attached to the rear; the propeller,
driven by an 80-horsepower motor, is at the
front.</p>

<p>Before we go on to other inventions let us look
closely at a few of the aeroplanes so well known
to-day, so that when we see them at the meets we
can distinguish the different makes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
AEROPLANES TO-DAY</h2>
</div>

<p class="hanging">OUR BOY FRIEND AND THE SCIENTIST LOOK OVER
MODERN AEROPLANES AND FIND GREAT IMPROVEMENTS
OVER THOSE OF A FEW YEARS AGO&mdash;A
MODEL AEROPLANE.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">E</span>VERY effort of the aeroplane inventors these
days is bent toward making the power flier
useful&mdash;a faithful servant to man in his day-to-day
life&mdash;and to this end greater carrying capacity
is one of the chief objects," said the scientist one day
in answer to a question from his young friend as to
what the future of aviation would be.</p>

<p>"No one can tell what the future will bring
forth," he continued. "You or one of your friends
might invent the ideal aeroplane. There is one
way of telling how the wind blows, though, and
that is by watching the new developments of
aeroplanes very carefully. Let's look at some of
them."</p>

<p>Of course it was impossible for the boy to study
every improvement or every make of aeroplane, but
the scientist pointed out a few examples that served
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
to show how science is trying to improve on aviation
as we know it to-day.</p>

<p>The boy's friend said that probably the most wonderful
accomplishment in the art of air navigation
since power fliers became an accomplished fact was
the work of Orville Wright in the fall of 1911 with
his new glider, which he tested at the Wright
brothers' old experiment station at Kitty Hawk,
N. C.</p>

<p>"Never before in the history of aviation, so far
as is known," said the scientist, "has man come so
near to the true soaring flight which we have seen
is the third stage of aeroplaning."</p>

<p>Not only did this wonderful glider sail into the
wind and reach an altitude of 200 feet, but, under the
control of the pilot, it stayed in the air 10 minutes
and 1 second, most of the time hovering over one
spot, without the use of any propelling device.</p>

<p>On the day of the great test the glider was taken
to the top of Kill Devil Hill, which is 110 feet high,
and while the wind was roaring through the canvas
at 42 miles an hour the machine was launched.
To those unaccustomed to the actions of gliders it
would have seemed that the engineless biplane would
be blown backward over the edge of the hill. Instead,
it shot forward and upward into the teeth of the
hurricane. The force of the wind on the planes,
which were presented diagonally to it, caused the
flier to rise and go ahead by just about the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
principle that a ship can sail almost into the teeth of
the wind by having her sails set at the proper angle.</p>

<p>When it had reached the altitude of 200 feet it
stopped motionless and to those below who saw
Orville Wright sitting calmly in the pilot's seat it
seemed that some unseen hand was holding him aloft.
Suddenly the pilot pressed a lever and the glider
darted 250 feet to the left, returned to her original
position, sank to within a few feet of the hillside
and hovered there for two minutes.</p>

<p>The Wrights had been working on the principles
involved for a long time and at the testing grounds
were Orville Wright, his brother Loren, who up to
that time had not been known to the world of aviation,
and Alexander Ogilvy, an English aviator.</p>

<p>After the remarkable test Orville Wright was asked,
"Have you solved real bird flight?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "but we have learned something
about it."</p>

<p>The aviator went on to explain that had he been
up 3,000 feet or so, where the wind currents are always
strong, he probably could have stayed up there
all night, or as long as he cared to.</p>

<p>This greatest of all feats of soaring was accomplished
in a glider that looked to the ordinary person
very much like the modern Wright biplane without
the engine. There were skids but they were
very low. In general outline the machine was composed
of two main planes, a vertical vane set out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
in front, two vertical planes at the rear of the tail,
and behind these the horizontal plane. The details
of the construction of the glider were not made
public and only a few persons saw it, but from all
accounts the curve of the main planes was much
greater than is usual, thus gaining the glider a greater
degree of support from the air, and the planes were
capable of being warped much more than in the
ordinary Wright biplane. The vertical vane in
front, which does not appear on any of the Wright
power fliers, was a foot wide and five feet tall. It
acted as a keel and gave the machine greater side-to-side
stability because the wind passing at a high
speed to each side of it tended to keep it vertical.</p>

<p>In working out a biplane that could rise from
or alight on the water, Glenn Curtiss practically
doubled the usefulness of aeroplanes. The experiments,
conducted under the auspices of the United
States Navy so impressed the officers that several
have been added to its equipment. Curtiss has
been experimenting with hydro-aeroplanes for several
years, but before actually completing one he
conducted a number of experiments with ordinary
biplanes in the vicinity of Hampton Roads, Va., in
1911, to prove them available for use on battleships.
Finally, Lieutenant Ely flew from the deck of the
cruiser <i>Birmingham</i> over the water and to a convenient
landing spot on land.</p>

<p>Later on Curtiss went to California to perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
his hydro-aeroplane, and while conducting the work
Lieutenant Ely made a flight from shore to the deck
of the battleship <i>Pennsylvania</i> which was lying in San
Francisco Harbour. These two incidents were more
in the nature of "stunts" than developments, but they
showed what an aeroplane could do if attached to a
battleship fleet as a scout.</p>

<p>Even more convincing was the proof when Curtiss
finally worked out a form of wooden float which
was put between the mounting wheels. The float
was flat-bottomed with an upward inclination at
the prow so that when skimming over the water the
tendency was to rise from the surface rather than to
cut through it. Small floats at the outer tips of the
lower main plane helped to keep the machine on an
even balance while floating at rest upon the water.
The wheels served their regular purpose if the
machine started from or alighted upon land.</p>

<p>The experiments were conducted on San Diego
Bay, and it was only after long and patient labour
that the work of Mr. Curtiss and his military associates
was rewarded with success. In the course of
the experiments he tried a triplane, which had great
lifting power, but this later was abandoned in favour
of the regular biplane fitted with a float. After the
machine had been perfected, Curtiss flew his hydro-aeroplane
out into the bay to the cruiser <i>Pennsylvania</i>,
upon which Ely had landed a month before,
and after landing on the water at the cruiser's side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
was pulled up to her deck and later was put back
into the water from where he sailed to camp. The
machine was named the <i>Triad</i> because it had conquered
air, land, and water.</p>

<p>Of the machine Curtiss says: "I believe the hydro-aeroplane
represents one of the longest and most
important strides in aviation. It robs the aeroplane
of many of its dangers, and as an engine of warfare
widens its scope of utility beyond the bounds of the
most vivid imagination. The hydro-aeroplane can
fly 60 miles an hour, skim the water at 50 miles and
run over the earth at 35 miles."</p>

<p>It was not long after the Curtiss hydro-aeroplane
had been successfully demonstrated, before all the
other leading makers brought out air craft that could
sail from and alight on water as well as on land. The
Wright hydro-aeroplane, which is equipped with two
long air-tight metal floats instead of one, has achieved
great success in the United States. In Europe all the
leading biplane types are now made with hydro-aeroplane
equipment, and flying over water became
as popular last year as flying over land did in 1910.</p>

<p>The first American monoplane to be equipped
with the floats of a hydro-plane was shown by the
"Queen" company at the New York Aero show in
May, 1912. It was called an aero boat as the front
part of the fuselage was enclosed like a boat and the
operator sat in it, under the wings. The propeller was
at the rear and there was a small pontoon at each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
end of the wings to keep it on an even keel when
stationary in the water. A short time after this
the Curtiss company turned out the flying boat
which was described on page <a href="#Page_90">90</a>.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In general outline the aeroplanes in use to-day
differ greatly from those seen several years ago, but
the difference is in form rather than in principle.
There have been many improvements, of course,
in construction, control of the fliers, and in the
powerful engines that drive them. In fact the
tendency of aeroplane builders has been to adopt
the successful devices on other machines rather than
to work out original ones.</p>

<p>The most noticeable change in the present-day
aeroplanes is the way in which builders nowadays
are enclosing the bodies and landing framework in
canvas or even light metal, so that they shall offer
as little resistance to the air as possible. It gives
the machines the appearance of being armoured, as
will be noticed from the pictures of the new planes,
so the term has come to be used in that sense,
although, of course, the covering would not protect
them against bullets. This armour has become
particularly popular with the designers who are
making aeroplanes for the French Army, and at the
recent military tests in France most of the machines
were covered to some degree, and many of them
looked for all the world like great long-bodied gulls
or mammoth flying fishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Several aeroplanes have been equipped with twin
motors and double steering systems so that either
or both could be used. This, of course, is a great
advantage in case one fails. Also designers are
figuring on wing surfaces that can be reefed or telescoped
for better stability as well as wings that can
be folded for easier transportation.</p>

<p>Experts do not agree on the respective merits of
the two great general types of aeroplanes&mdash;that is,
monoplanes and biplanes. Some claim that the
monoplane is the best and others that the biplane
is the most successful flier. Records show that so
far monoplanes are the faster of the two types, but
biplanes can be fitted with hydro-aeroplane floats,
whereas it is impractical with most monoplanes.
Many declare the biplane to have the greater lifting
power, but the Bl√©riot "Aero-Bus" has carried a jolly
family party of eight without difficulty. Each type
has its champions as to safety, reliability and endurance,
but time will have to decide the question.</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>WRIGHT BIPLANE</h3>
</div>

<p>First let us look at one of the latest Wright biplanes
as it is brought out on the aviation field and is being
tuned up by its keen-eyed young American pilot. The
description of the 1909 Wright will be remembered.
Also it will be remembered how the Wright brothers
in 1910 discarded the forward horizontal elevating
rudder entirely, and substituted in its place a single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
elevating rudder at the rear end of the tail, which
also served to give fore and aft stability. Also in
1910 the Wright brothers added wheels to the skids
that hitherto had been used for starting and alighting.
Thus the old system of having the machine skidded
along a rail by a falling weight, as previously described,
was done away with in favour of its running
over the ground on its wheels.</p>

<p>After noting these improvements, we will look at
the general outlines of such a Wright racing machine
as contested for the James Gordon Bennett Cup
in 1910. The two main planes are the smallest
yet used on a biplane, being only 21-1/2 feet wide
from tip to tip, and only 3-1/2 feet from front to rear.
Thus, the aspect ratio, it will be seen is 7. They are
the same general shape as the planes on the
other Wright machines, and their total area is 145
square feet. The machine is steered up or down by
the horizontal elevator rudder in the rear, which
is oblong-shaped, 8 by 2 feet. The rudder that
steers the machine from right to left is set vertically
at the tail and is worked in combination with the
levers that work the warping of the tips of the
planes. On this little machine the twin-screw
propellers, 8-1/2 feet in diameter, sweep practically
the whole width of the machine. They are connected
by chains to the 60-horsepower 8-cylinder Wright
engine (in ordinary biplanes of this type the
engine is 30 horsepower) and make 525 revolutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
per minute (in ordinary machines of this type they
make 450 revolutions per minute). The machine
weighs a total of 760 pounds and is capable of more
than 60 miles an hour.</p>

<p>The elevation rudder is controlled by a lever set
either at the right or left hand of the operator. The
direction rudder is controlled by a lever that also
controls the warping of the planes, as in turning it
is necessary to cant the machine over to the inner
side of the curve being made, in order to prevent
slipping sidewise through the air. However the
handle of the direction and warping lever is so arranged
by a clutch system that by moving the lever
simply from side to side the direction lever can be
worked independently of the warping. The direction
and balancing system then, we see, is worked in
this manner. Say, while flying, a gust of wind
causes the biplane to dip at the right end. The
operator quickly moves his warping lever forward.
This pulls down the tips of the right planes,
and at the same time elevates the tips of the
left planes. The change of the angle makes the
right side lift to its normal position while it makes
the left side drop. Consequently the machine is
restored to an even keel and the operator lets the
planes spring back to their normal shape.</p>

<p>The large 1911 Wright biplanes, model B, are designed
the same as the small racing models except
that the wings have a spread of 39 feet, and a depth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
of 6-1/4 feet&mdash;a total area of 440 square feet. The
perpendicular triangular surfaces in front like two
little jib sails, are a distinguishing feature, although
the latest Wright models substitute narrow vertical
fins about six feet tall and six inches wide. They are
placed immediately in front of the main planes. The
hydro-aeroplane substitutes two aluminum floats
for the wheels.</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>CURTISS BIPLANE</h3>
</div>

<p>The Curtiss biplane, which we have seen has had
a great deal to do with the development of aviation,
is one of the simplest and most successful
machines known to-day. The main planes of the
regular-sized machines have a spread of 26-1/2 feet,
are set 5 feet apart, and have a depth from front to
rear of 4-1/2 feet. The total wing area is 220 feet.
The direction rudder is a single vertical vane at the
rear, which is turned by the steering wheel connected
by cables. The elevation rudder consisting of one
horizontal plane 24 square feet in area is at the
front and is turned up or down by the pilot as he
desires to sail up or down, by means of a long
bamboo pole connecting the elevation rudder with
his pilot wheel. He pushes the wheel forward or
back to rise or descend, while he twists it from
right to left to turn in either of those directions.
The side-to-side balance was maintained in the early
Curtiss machines by flexible wing tips, but these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
later were replaced by ailerons placed between
and at the outer tips of the main planes. Each
aileron had an area of 12 square feet and they were
operated by a brace fitted to the operator's body.
Thus, if the machine tipped to the right, the operator
would swing to the left, turn the ailerons, and right
the machine. In some later Curtiss biplanes these
ailerons were replaced by others, like flaps attached
to the rear outer edges of the main planes. By raising
the flaps on one side and lowering them on the other
the balance was well preserved.</p>

<p>As before stated, these machines are driven by
Curtiss engines. In most of them the engines are
4-cylinder, 25-horsepower motors. The cylinders
in this type, of course, are stationary, but the engine
shaft is directly connected with the 6-foot propeller
at the rear, which makes 1,200 revolutions per minute.
The pilot sits between the two main planes
of his engine. On large Curtiss machines seats for
as many as three passengers have been arranged at
the sides of the pilot.</p>

<p>The most important work Curtiss has done in
the last few years is the development of the hydro-aeroplane,
which has been explained.</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>VOISIN BIPLANE</h3>
</div>

<p>The next biplane with which we are familiar is the
Voisin, which Henri Farman demonstrated as the
first really successful aeroplane seen in Europe. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
machine was a standard of what was called the
cellular type because it was composed of cells, like
a box kite. The two main planes, which were the
same size, 37 feet by 6-1/2 feet, were connected at the
outer edges so as to make the plane a closed cell&mdash;i. e.,
a box with the ends knocked out. Two other vertical
surfaces between the main plane gave the machine
the appearance of three box kites side by side. The
tail out behind was composed of a square cell. In
the centre of it was a vertical vane for steering it
from right to left, while out in front was a single
horizontal rudder for raising or lowering the plane.
The control was much the same as in the Curtiss
machine. The steering wheel turned the plane from
right to left, and was connected by a rod with the
elevator, so that by pushing it forward or back, the
machine was raised or lowered. There was no device
for maintaining a side-to-side balance as the cell
formation was supposed to keep the machine on an
even keel. The motor drove a propeller at the rear.</p>

<p>The later Bordeaux type of Voisin which was built
for military purposes does away with the side curtains
and box tail. On the outer rear edge of the upper
main plane are ailerons for maintaining the balance,
which are operated by foot pedals. The elevator
is a single horizontal plane at the rear of the tail,
while the direction rudder is a vertical plane beneath
it. This machine carries two persons, and is frequently
driven by a Gnome engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Still another and later type of the Voisin Bordeaux
is the front control. In this the ailerons are used
as previously described, but also there are side
curtains enclosing the outer edges of the main planes.
Out in front at the end of a long framework or
fuselage are the horizontal elevating planes, and the
vertical direction planes. Both these machines have
double control systems.</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>FARMAN BIPLANE</h3>
</div>

<p>Dissatisfied with the work of his first Voisin biplane
in the early days of flying Henri Farman designed
and built a machine that bore his own
name, of which the military type is now looked
upon with great favour by many of the European
experts.</p>

<p>The two main supporting planes in the regular
Farman models were 33 feet by 6-1/2 feet, set 7 feet
apart, and with a total area of 430 square feet. These
dimensions have been varied slightly in other machines.
The elevating rudder, which was set well
out in front of the body of the machine, was a horizontal
plane controlled by a wire and lever. In the rear
was a tail of two parallel surfaces, slightly curved
like the main planes of the biplanes. These two
surfaces steadied the machine from front to rear. At
their two sides were two vertical surfaces, giving the
tail the appearance of a box kite, so familiar in the
Voisin. These two vertical surfaces, however, comprised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the direction rudder, and were turned from
side to side by the operator with a foot lever. In
some of the later Farman biplanes the two vertical surfaces
were done away with in favour of a single one,
extending between the centres of the two horizontal
surfaces of the tail. The side-to-side balance was
maintained by ailerons in the form of wing tips set
at the outer rear edges of the main planes. The tips
were hinged and connected with wires which led
to the lever that worked the elevating rudder. Thus
by pulling this lever toward him the operator tilted
the rudder up, and the machine rose, and by moving
it from side to side the biplane was kept on an even
keel. For instance, if the machine were to tip to
the right he would move the lever to the left, pulling
<i>down</i> the hinged ailerons on the right. The ones
on the left would still remain standing straight out
at the same angle as the main planes. The increase
in the lifting power on the right side would cause that
end to rise, righting the machine.</p>

<p>Most Farman biplanes these days are driven by
the well known 7-cylinder Gnome rotary air-cooled
engines, set at the rear of the main plane. They
are directly connected with the single propeller,
which is 8-1/2 feet in diameter. The seat for the aviator
is in front of the engine at the front edge of the lower
plane, and there also frequently are placed seats for
two other passengers. The machine is mounted on
wheels and skids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
The "Farman Militaire" type is one of the largest
and heaviest machines made to date, having a total
area of supporting plane of 540 square feet. The
chief difference is that instead of two direction
rudders there are three, and that the lower main
plane is set at a dihedral angle. It was on such a
machine ("Type Michelin") that Farman flew
steadily for eight and a half hours. It also has made
remarkable distance, endurance, and weight-carrying
records, although it is a slow machine, making but
34 to 35 miles an hour. The "Type Michelin" is
distinguished by the fact that the upper main plane
has a spread of 49 feet, 3 inches, while the lower
plane had a spread of only 36 feet.</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>MAURICE FARMAN BIPLANE</h3>
</div>

<p>Soon after Henri Farman had become famous as an
aviator and constructor of aeroplanes, his brother
Maurice began to build air craft. The Maurice
Farman biplane was the result. After conducting
their business separately for several years the
brothers consolidated, and each type is known by
the name of the brother designing it. The Maurice
Farman biplane has some remarkable records, among
them the winning of the Michelin prize in 1910 by
Tabuteau, who flew 362-1/2 miles in seven and a half
hours without stopping.</p>

<p>The main planes have a spread of 36 feet and a
depth of 7-1/2 feet. They have not as great a curve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
or camber as most biplanes, which increases their
speed. The tail is of the well-known Farman cell
formation&mdash;that is, it has four sides. The two
vertical surfaces swing on pivots and are controlled
by wires connecting with the direction steering wheel.
The horizontal surfaces of the tail, except for the
tips, are stationary, and steady the machine from
front to rear. The rear tips of these two surfaces,
however, work on pivots in connection with the main
elevating plane which is set out in front. The elevator
is a single plane controlled by a rod connected with
the steering wheel, while the tips of the horizontal
tail surfaces are controlled in unison with the main
elevator by wires, also connected with the steering
wheel. Ailerons are set into the rear outer tips of
the main planes, for the control of the side-to-side
balance, and these are worked by foot pedals. In
order to give greater safety in case of the breakage
of a wire, all the controlling parts in the Maurice
Farman machine are duplicate, which is a big step
toward the much-desired double controlling system
in aeroplanes. The biplane is mounted on both skids
and wheels. The operator sits well forward on the
lower plane in a comfortable little pit enclosed in
canvas. Thus, the Maurice Farman machine was
the first to adopt this device for shielding the pilot
from the wind. The engine used usually is an 8-cylinder
air-cooled Renault, which drives a propeller
nearly 10 feet in diameter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h3>BREGUET BIPLANE</h3>
</div>

<p>Only slightly known in the United States but well
and favourably known in Europe, particularly in
France, is the Breguet biplane, which made wonderful
records in the French Army tests in 1911. A brief
description will show the difference between this
machine and others of the biplane type. It has won
many prizes for its stability and lifting powers, and
also has shown great speed. The framework is
mostly metal and is so elastic that it gives under the
pulsations for the wind, so that the machine is not
so badly strained by gusts as the more rigid kinds.
Also it is thought the elasticity increases its lifting
capacity. Of the two main planes the upper one
spreads 43-1/2 feet, while the lower one spreads 32-1/2
feet. They are 5-1/2 feet deep, and set 7 feet apart.
The body and tail of the machine are made on delicate
graceful lines, terminating in the elevation and
direction rudders at the rear. There are no rudders,
vanes, or other rigging out in front. The lateral
balance is maintained by warping the planes. The
propeller is at the front of the machine, and is of the
tractor type, pulling it through the air instead of
pushing it. In the latest machines a metallic three-bladed
Breguet propeller, the pitch of which is self-adjusting,
is used, but in others a two-bladed wooden
propeller, such as is familiar in this country. The
long body, or fuselage, as the framework of the tail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
is called, is enclosed on the latest types of Breguets
in use by the French Army, greatly adding to its
gracefulness, and decreasing the wind pressure.</p>

<p>There are several other makes of biplanes that
could be described to advantage but space prevents
it, and the descriptions here given serve to illustrate
the principle of the biplane type of aeroplane.</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>BL√âRIOT MONOPLANE</h3>
</div>

<p>The first and probably best known monoplane,
the Bl√©riot, still holds many records for both speed
and endurance. The Bl√©riot machines have so many
variations that it would be impossible to describe all
the types of monoplanes this versatile Frenchman
has turned out. We are familiar in a general way
with the Bl√©riot, the single widespreading main
plane, set at a slight dihedral angle, with its long,
graceful body out behind terminating in the horizontal
elevating and vertical direction rudders, giving it
the appearance of a great soaring bird as it sails
through the air as steadily as an automobile on a
smooth road&mdash;much more steadily in fact, for as
soon as the wheels of an aeroplane leave the ground
all jolting disappears, and not even the vibration
of the engine is noticeable, although the roar of its
explosions can be heard a great distance. There
is nothing but the breeze and the earth streaming
along behind you, as if it were moving and you were
hovering motionless high up in the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
In the famous Bl√©riot XI, in which the designer
made the first trip across the English Channel, the
main plane had a spread of a little more than 28 feet
and a depth of 6-1/2 feet, a total area of 151 square feet
and a low aspect ratio of about 4.6. At the end
of the stout wooden framework, that made up the body
and tail, was the vertical direction rudder 4-1/2 square
feet in area which was turned from right to left by a
foot lever. The elevation rudder was divided into
two halves, one part being put at each side of the
direction rudder. The total area of the elevator
was 16 square feet, while the horizontal stabilizing
plane to which the elevator was attached was about
the same. The balance was maintained by warping
the main plane, but instead of warping the tips of
the plane, as is done in the Wright biplanes, the two
sides of the main plane were warped from the base,
so that the operator could change the angle of incidence&mdash;that
is, the angle at which the planes travel
through the air. Thus, if the machine should tip
down on the right side, the operator would warp the
planes so as to increase the angle of incidence on the
right side and lessen it on the left side. In other
words, the rear part of the right wing would be bent
downward, while on the left side the rear edge would
be raised. The forward edge remains stationary.
The increase of the angle on the right side would
cause an increase of the lifting power on that side
and also the decrease of the angle on the left side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
would lessen the lifting power of the left wing so
the right side, which was tipping down, would be
lifted, and the machine restored to an even keel. This
warping was done by moving from side to side the
same lever on which was mounted the steering wheel.
The whole machine was mounted on a strong chassis
with wheels for starting and alighting. The pilot sat
in the framework above the main plane. The monoplane
was propelled by a single propeller of the tractor
type 6 to 7 feet in diameter, placed at the front of the
machine. It was driven in the early Bl√©riots by a
23-horsepower Anzani motor, but more lately the
Bl√©riot machines have carried Gnome motors.</p>

<p>One of the important improvements which appeared
on the No. XI <i>bis</i> was the changing of the
main plane so that the upper side was curved but the
under side was nearly flat. This gave the machine
much more speed and the designers found that the
flattening out of the curve on the under side did not
greatly lessen the lifting power. This same type
of machine also was made later to carry three passengers.
The machine known as the "Type Militaire"
was just about like the others except that the
tail instead of being rectangular was fan-shaped. It
carried seats for two and was equipped with all the
latest aviation accoutrements, such as tachometers,
barographs to record altitude, instrument to record
inclination, various other gauges, map cases and
thermos bottles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
The most distinctive feature of the Bl√©riot No.
XII, which was the first aeroplane to carry three
passengers, was the long vertical keel, shaped like
the fin of a fish at the top of the framework. The
direction rudder was at the rear of this keel, while
the elevation rudder was at the rear and a little
below it. Immediately below the direction rudder
was a small horizontal plane about the size of the
elevation rudder which helped to maintain a fore
and aft stability.</p>

<p>Then there was the famous Bl√©riot aerobus which
would carry 8 to 10 people. The machine was very
large, the wings having a spread of 39 feet and a
total area of 430 square feet. It was driven by a
100-horsepower Gnome motor and a propeller 10
feet in diameter, which was placed at the rear of the
main plane. Thus the propeller drove the machine
through the air from the rear instead of pulling it
from the front as do the tractor propellers on most
of the Bl√©riot monoplanes. The passengers were
seated underneath the main plane on the framework
which extended out to the rear. The tail terminated
in the vertical direction rudder and a large stationary
horizontal surface which gave the necessary front-to-rear
stability. The elevating plane of this type
was placed out in front.</p>

machines is that the body extends out in front of the
main plane instead of behind, something like Santos-Dumont's
first machine. The main plane has a
spread of 29 feet, and has a total supporting surface
of 129 square feet. At the forward end of the body
is placed the horizontal elevating rudder, while two
small vertical rudders, placed on the top of the outer
ends of the main plane and working in unison, serve
to steer it from side to side. The balance in this
machine is preserved by large hinged ailerons at the
outer rear edges of the main plane. The pilot sits
in front of the engine underneath the plane, which
is a military advantage, giving him ample chance for
looking down and observing everything over which
he is passing.</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>ANTOINETTE MONOPLANE</h3>
</div>

<p>No machine that ever was flown has excited more
admiration from those on the ground than the
graceful Antoinette monoplane, designed by the
famous French motor-boat builder, Levavasseur.
Its great tapering wings and long fan-shaped tail
give it the appearance of a huge swallow or dragon-fly
as it sails through the air, and whenever this
type has appeared at the American meets it has received
tremendous applause.</p>

<p>The two best known models of the Antoinette are
the type used by Latham in this country, and the
"armoured" type, entered in the French military
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
tests. The bow of the first-mentioned machine is
shaped very much like the prow of a boat with the
50 to 100 horsepower 8-or 16-cylinder water-cooled
Antoinette engine occupying the extreme forward
part. The propeller is set in front of this, and is
of the tractor type, drawing the machine through the
air behind it. In the recent models of the Antoinette,
the main plane, set at a slight dihedral angle, spread
a little more than 49 feet (compare this with the spread
of 28 feet of the Bl√©riot). The two sides of the main
plane taper from the body of the machine, but have
an average depth from front to rear of 8 feet, which
gives a fairly high aspect ratio of about 6. The
total area is 405 square feet. The main plane also
tapers in thickness, being nearly a foot through close
to the body and tapering down to a few inches
at the outer tips. The graceful tail at the rear has
both vertical and horizontal surfaces gently tapering
to the height and width of the elevating and direction
rudders. The elevating rudder is a single horizontal
triangular surface at the rear controlled by cables
running to a pilot wheel at the operator's right hand.
It has an area of 20 square feet. The direction
rudder is composed of two triangular surfaces with
an area of 10 square feet each. One is above the
elevator and the other below, but both are worked
in unison by wires connecting with a foot lever.
The machine is balanced by a warping system
much like that on the Wright biplanes we know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
so well. This is accomplished by wires connecting
with a steering wheel at the pilot's left hand, so
that he uses his right hand to steer his machine up
or down, his feet to steer from right to left, and
his left hand to maintain the balance. Of course,
in making a sharp turn he uses his warping wheel
as well as his direction wheel, because, as previously
explained, it is necessary to incline the machine
over toward the inside of the curve desired
to be made. The pilot sits in the framework, above
and a little back of the supporting plane.</p>

<p>The "armoured" Antoinette, which was designed
for military purposes, is entirely enclosed, even increasing
the already great resemblance to a bird,
while the direction rudder is made of a single surface,
and the elevating rudder of two rhomboid-shaped
rudders. The pilot sits in a cockpit with only his
head and shoulders protruding above and has a view
below through a glass floor. Its most important
feature is the total elimination of cross wires, struts
and the like. The resistance is greatly decreased,
but the weight increased. In addition, a peculiar
wing section is used, flat on the under side and curved
on the upper side. The wings are immensely thick,
being entirely braced from the inside. At the body
the wings are over two feet thick. Their thickness
decreases toward the tips, which are about eight
inches thick. The shape of each wing is called
trapesoidal, and they are set at a large dihedral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
angle. The motor is a regular 100-horsepower
Antoinette.</p>

<p>The oddest feature of this type is the landing
gear, which is entirely enclosed to within a few inches
of the ground; the landing wheels at the front are
six in number, three on each side of the centre, enclosed
in what is called a "skirt." At the rear are
two smaller wheels.</p>

<p>The dimensions are roughly as follows: Spread,
52-1/2 feet, wings, 602 square feet; length over all, 36 feet;
depth of wings (from front to rear) at tips, over 9
feet, increasing to almost 13 feet at the centre. The
total weight is nearly 2,400 pounds.</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>NIEUPORT MONOPLANE</h3>
</div>

<p>The Nieuport monoplane is one of the newer machines
that has attracted a great deal of attention
for its speed with low-powered engines. Among the
achievements of this monoplane was Weyman's winning
of the James Gordon Bennett Cup and prize in
England in 1911, and the demonstration of its remarkable
passenger carrying abilities. The Nieuport also
is a wonderful glider, for Claude Grahame-White took
his new one up 3,000 feet at Nassau Boulevard,
Garden City, during the 1911 meet there and glided
down the whole distance without power, the downward
sail taking him nearly as long as the upward
climb.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The passenger machine has a spread of 36 feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
with a length of about 24 feet from front to rear.
This machine is generally equipped with a 50 or
70 horsepower Gnome motor, although the plane
with which Weyman won the Gordon Bennett contest
was equipped with a 100-horsepower Gnome motor.
The smaller machine has a spread of 27 feet, 6
inches and a length of 23 feet. An engine of the 3-cylinder
Anzani type is usually mounted on this
monoplane.</p>

<p>The body of the flier gracefully tapers to a
point at the rear where are placed the elevating and
steering rudders.</p>

<p>The chief characteristics of the Nieuport are
strength, simplicity in design, and great efficiency of
operation. The smaller machine, which is equipped
with an engine of from 18 to 20 horsepower, has acquired
a speed of 52-1/2 miles an hour. The Nieuport
is constructed along original lines throughout. The
wings are very thick at the front edge, while the
rear edges are flexible so that in gusts of wind they
give a little.</p>

<p>The fuselage, or body of the machine, which is
extraordinarily large, and shaped like the body of
a bird, is entirely covered with canvas.</p>

<p>The weakest part of the Nieuport monoplane is
the alighting and running gear, which is so designed
as to eliminate head resistance, but unfortunately
this simplicity is carried to an extreme which makes
the machine the most difficult one to run along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
ground, and to this construction may be traced most
of the accidents which have occurred to the Nieuport
machines.</p>

<p>The Nieuport control differs from that of the
majority of other machines inasmuch as the wing
warping is controlled by the feet, while hand levers
operate the vertical and elevating rudders.</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>MODEL AEROPLANES</h3>
</div>

<p>After having taken in such a lot of information
about aeroplanes the scientist's young friend considered
himself fairly well equipped to build a flier.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't I build a little model aeroplane?"
he said one day.</p>

<p>"No reason why young couldn't," answered his friend
in the laboratory. "You have a little workshop
at home and your own simple tools will be plenty.
You will have to buy some of your materials, but
they are all cheap.</p>

<p>"There is no sport like model aeroplane flying,
but to the average American boy the flying is not
half so much fun as meeting and overcoming the
obstacles and problems entailed in making the little
plane. These days nearly any boy would scorn to
enter a model aeroplane tournament with any machine
that he did not make himself, and a great
many of the amateur aviators even prefer to
make their own designs and plans.</p>

<p>"When we begin to take up the construction of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
glider or an aeroplane, we must, like the Wright
brothers, reluctantly enter upon the scientific side
of it, because in model building we cannot simply
make exact reproductions of the great man-carrying
fliers, but must meet and overcome new problems.
The laws that govern the standard aeroplanes apply
a little differently to models, so it is necessary for
the model builder to figure things out for himself.</p>

<p>"For instance," explained the scientist, "most
amateurs have decided that monoplane models fly
much better than biplanes. The reason for this is
probably that with the miniature makes the air is
so disturbed by the propeller that its action on the
lower plane tends to make it unsteady rather than
to give it a greater lifting capacity. This could be
avoided by placing the two planes farther apart,
but they would have to be so far separated that the
machine would be ungainly and out of all proportion.
Moreover, the second plane, with the necessary stays
and trusses, adds to the weight of the machine, and
this is always bad in models.</p>

<p>"There are as many different types of model aeroplanes
as there are of the big man carriers, but you
had better make a small flier first, experiment with
it, and then work out your own variations just as you
think best."</p>

<p>"Will you help me build one?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"No, for you don't need my help and you will have
more fun doing it alone. I will tell you how to go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
about it, and with what you know of the principles
of aviation from our conversations it will be easy
to make a successful model."</p>

<p>Then taking a piece of paper and a pencil the
scientist began to draw rough plans for the building of
a little model monoplane something like the Bl√©riot,
except that it was driven tail first, with the propeller at
the rear. As he worked he explained how the plan
shown below should be followed, saying that the beginner
would find that a length of about one foot would
be the most convenient for this first model. Later
on he can make the big ones with a spread of wings
of three feet, and a length of forty
or more inches.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>A SIMPLE MODEL AEROPLANE</p>
</div></div>

<p>First, the three main parts of the model should
be made. Those are the two main planes and
backbone. The simplest way of making the planes
for a model of this kind is to use thin boards of poplar
or spruce, which will not split easily and which can
be worked with a jackknife. The large plane should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
be rectangular, with a spread of eight inches and a
depth of two inches, while the smaller plane should
be the same shape, four by one inch. They should
be one eighth of an inch or less in thickness. Plane
and sandpaper them down as thin and as smooth
as possible without splitting them, and round off the
corners just enough to do away with sharp edges.
Now draw a line parallel with the side that is eight
inches long, three quarters of an inch from the edge.
Measure off two inches toward the centre from the
outer edges, along this line, and draw lines parallel
with the edges that are two inches deep. At the
corners which are to be the rear we find the lines
make two rectangles three quarters of an inch by
two inches, and these corners are to be cut away in a
graceful curve from the corners of the rectangles.
When it is done the main plane will be shaped like
a big D with the curved edge to the rear. The front
edge of the small plane also should be curved, but
not nearly so much as the larger plane. This done,
the planes can be steamed or moistened with varnish,
and given a slight curve or camber by laying them on
a flat board with a little stick underneath and weights
at the front and back to hold down the edges while
they dry and set. The sticks should be about one
third of the way back from the front edges, from there
tapering down to the level of the rear edge. Of
course, in this process great care must be used not
to split the delicate planes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
There are many other ways of making planes. If
one does not care to round off the edges, he can make
very light wooden rectangular frames of the size
indicated, and cover them with cloth, or silk, afterward
varnishing them to make them smooth and
air-tight. It is difficult to give such planes a camber,
but if the framework is made of strong light wire,
such as umbrella ribs, and then covered, the camber
can be obtained by putting light wire or light wooden
ribs in the planes, much like on the big standard
makes. Plane building can be developed to a high
art, and after a boy makes one or two models he will
see any number of ways that he can make them
lighter, stronger and more professional looking.</p>

<p>With the planes finished, the next work is to make
the backbone of the machine by planing and sandpapering
a light strong stick one foot long and not
more than a quarter of an inch square. Cut out a
neat block of the same wood, the same thickness as
the backbone, and one inch square. Glue it to the
end of the backbone and reinforce it by wrapping
it with silken thread moistened with glue or varnish.
Be sure to have the grain of this block, which is the
motor base, run the same as the backbone. Three
quarters of an inch from the backbone, and parallel
with it, bore a little hole for the propeller shaft or
axle. Unless you are sure of your drill, heat a thin
steel wire and burn the hole, rather than risk splitting
the block.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
The propeller is the next thing to make, while the
glue on the backbone is drying, and the camber of the
plane is setting. Some models have metal propellers,
but most boys prefer to make wooden ones,
either from blocks of their own cutting or from blanks
that can be purchased. The blank should be four
inches in diameter an inch wide, and half an inch
thick. It can be cut away very thin with a sharp
knife, and a fairly good whittler can make a propeller
that looks as businesslike as the great gleaming
blades on the big machines. A wire then should
be run through the dead centre of the propeller and
bent over so that when the wire shaft turns the propeller
also turns. As a bearing or washer the simplest
device is a glass bead strung on the shaft and well
oiled to lessen the friction, between the propeller and
the propeller base. The shaft is then run through
the hole in the motor base and bent into a hook for
the rubber strands that drive the propeller. Great
care should be taken in mounting the propeller and
making the hook that the shaft is kept in an absolutely
straight line, and at an accurate right angle
with the propeller, so that the screw can turn free
and true with as little friction as possible, and no
wobbling or unbusinesslike vibration. Next a wire
hook should be placed at the other end of the backbone
upon which to hook the other end of the rubber
strands. This hook can either be imbedded in
another block the same size as the motor base or can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
be set out by some other ingenious device, so that
the strands will turn free of the backbone, and will
make an even line parallel with it. Both hooks should
be covered by little pieces of rubber tubing to protect
the rubber strands. Any friction whatever in a
model is bad, but it is worst of all upon the rubber
strands of the motor.</p>

<p>With the parts in hand the next step is attaching
the planes to the backbone. In this machine the
motor should be above the planes, so that the planes
should be affixed to the upper side of the central
stick, with the rubber strands above them. The
propeller is at the rear, so the small front plane
should be placed at the front, with the slightly curved
edge to the rear. It should be about an inch from the
tip of the stick and the front edge should be elevated
slightly to give the necessary lifting power. The
main plane should be placed about an inch from the
rear tip of the backbone, with the curved edge to the
rear and the front slightly elevated. The planes
should be affixed with rubber bands so that it is
possible to move them forward or back, because the
little monoplane might be lacking in fore and aft
stability and the rearrangement of the planes might
correct it. It might even be found more satisfactory
in some models to change the order and let the propeller,
base, and strands of the motor come below
the planes instead of above them. Your own experience
will tell best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Of course, the planes must be placed on the backbone
exactly evenly or the airship will be lopsided, a
fatal fault. By experimenting, the boy can tell just
how high the front edges should be elevated, or, in
other words, what angle of incidence he should give
his plane. A rudder, to keep the machine in a
straight course, can be added underneath the centre
of the main plane. It should be about two inches
square, but shaved off to a curving razor edge. Also
light skids of cane or rattan may be added. They
should be glued to the under side of the backbone
and curved backward like sled runners. The front
one should be two and a half to three inches high,
while the rear one should be about an inch to an inch
and a half less.</p>

<p>After trying out the model as a glider by throwing
it across a room and making sure it is well balanced
both laterally and longitudinally, or from side to
side, and fore and aft, the rubber strands can
be put on, and the motor wound up. About
four strands of rubber one eighth of an inch
square, such as is sold for this purpose, would
suffice for good flights of more than one hundred
feet, if the machine were of the same weight and
proportions as the model from which this description
was written. In models, however, there are many
little details that can change the conditions, and
a boy can only experiment, locate his mistakes, and
try it over again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
This is one of the simplest and easiest model aeroplanes
that can be made. A trip to one of the model
aeroplane tournaments will reveal dozens of more
elaborate ones, which will give any ingenious boy
ideas for development of the principles he can learn
from the simpler type. Probably the next step of
the average boy would be to build a machine with
two motors, which can be done by elaborating the
single stick backbone or by making a backbone of
two or three sticks well braced with cross pieces
at each end and in the middle. Then there are
interesting experiments with the size of planes,
number of planes, their aspect ratio&mdash;that is the
proportion of their width to their depth&mdash;ailerons
for automatic stability, and rudders for keeping
the machine on a straight course. There are
always new things to be done with the motors,
because, though the rubber motors have driven
models close to half a mile, there are now on the
market miniature gasoline motors to drive models,
and experiments are being tried with clockwork
and compressed air. Indeed the model aeroplane
field is as broad in itself as that of the man-carrying
machines.</p>

<p>Aviation has been reduced to an exact science, but
it is yet in its early growth, both in the field of models
and in the field of the various kinds of man-carrying
machines. Not only are the designers making great
headway with aeroplanes, but also with dirigible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
balloons so any one interested in aeronautics has
a very wide field for his work. As we said in an
earlier chapter, the boy model designer of to-day
may be the inventor of to-morrow who gains undying
fame by some now undreamed-of development of
the aeroplane.</p>

<p>The designers of the man carriers are trying to make
their machines stronger, safer, more reliable, capable
of carrying more passengers, and they hope at last
to bring them to a more practical use in the world
than as a sport. The most thoughtful aviators
do not favour exhibition flying so strongly as
they do long cross-country flights, endurance tests,
passenger-carrying tests, and other experiments that
will develop aeroplanes beyond their present limitations.</p>

<p>The next great feat of the aeroplane is the crossing
of the Atlantic Ocean, and that may not be far
distant, for at the time of writing half a dozen aviators
are planning the attempt, but even more important
than that, even more important than the development
of the aeroplane for war scouting, is the development
of the aeroplane as a faithful servant of the
people who are quietly going about their own everyday
business. The time will come when the readers
of this may send their mail by aeroplane, take pleasure
rides in the aeroplane instead of the automobile,
and even make regular trips on regularly established
aeroplane routes, buying their tickets at the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
central aeroplane stations as they would buy railroad
tickets in the Grand Central or the Pennsylvania
stations to-day, taking their seats in comfortably
arranged aero cars, and being whisked in a few
hours from one part of the country to the other, and
even from one side of the ocean to the other.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
ARTIFICIAL LIGHTNING MADE AND HARNESSED<br />
TO MAN'S USE</h2>
</div>

<p class="hanging">OUR FRIENDS INVESTIGATE NIKOLA TESLA'S INVENTION
FOR THE WIRELESS TRANSMISSION OF POWER,
BY WHICH HE HOPES TO ENCIRCLE THE EARTH
WITH LIMITLESS ELECTRICAL POWER, MAKE OCEAN
AND AIR TRAVEL ABSOLUTELY SAFE, AND REVOLUTIONIZE
LAND TRAFFIC.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap3">"H</span>OW would you like to send a signal clear
through the earth with your wireless outfit
and get it back again on your receiving
instrument as clear and strong as at first, just about
the same way you hear the echo of your voice when
it rebounds from a mountainside or a big building?"
asked the scientist one day while his young friend
was telling him about his amateur wireless experiments.</p>

<p>"I don't see how I could," answered the boy.</p>

<p>"No, of course you don't," said the boy's friend,
"for it took Nikola Tesla, 'the wizard of electricity'
almost a lifetime to work out the invention
by which he could do that, but if you like we will go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
and see Doctor Tesla and ask him to tell us about
his wonderful experiments.</p>

<p>"You see this is a series of inventions by Tesla,
and wireless telegraphy is only a small part of it.
You remember the other day you told me of
having read about aeroplanes equipped with wireless.
Just think, Tesla's invention will make it
possible for airships to be propelled and operated
all by electricity sent without wires. The whole
broad plan is called the wireless transmission of
power, and that simply means that electricity can be
transmitted without wires for all the uses we now
have for it, as well as for a number of entirely new
and hitherto unknown devices."</p>

<p>The boy was delighted with the prospect of
seeing the great scientist Tesla, about whom he
had read so much, and began to ask his older
friend a thousand questions about the man, his
work and life.</p>

<p>It was a good many days before the whole thing
had been talked over, and the boy understood the
series of inventions, but we will follow through a part
of our scientist's explanation and the visit to Tesla's
laboratory and plant.</p>

<p>Although Tesla's plan is one of the most astounding
ever proposed by science, it has been proved
possible by experiments of such hair-raising nature
that the inventor has been called a "daredevil" a
"demon in electricity" and a "dreamer of dynamic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
dreams." In his experiments he has produced
electrical currents of a voltage higher even than the
bolts of lightning we see cleaving the sky during the
worst thunderstorms. These currents he has harnessed
to his own use and made them tell him the
inmost secrets of the earth&mdash;in fact of the palpitation
at the very core of the globe&mdash;the heartbeats of
our sphere. He has given exhibitions in which he
has caused currents of inconceivably high power to
play about his head as if they were gentle summer
breezes, and while working in the mountains of
Colorado, he has brought forth electrical discharges
which caused disturbances in the wireless telegraph
apparatus in all parts of the globe.</p>

<p>In short, Nikola Tesla plans to make artificial
lightning, and so harness it to the use of man, that
it can be sent anywhere on or above the earth,
without wires.</p>

<p>To scientists and electrical engineers, Tesla's plan
offers a field for limitless study and discussion, but
to the boy who is interested in electricity it offers
one of the most fascinating subjects for reading and
thinking in all the realm of science. Just reflect
that with the wireless transmission of power, and
the development of an art that Tesla calls "telautomatics,"
the navigators of wireless power-driven airships
and ocean liners will know their exact speed,
position, altitude, direction, the time of night or
day, and whether there is anything in their path,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
all through the wireless "telautomatic" devices for
registering such impressions.</p>

<p>Tesla declares that the terrible <i>Titanic</i> disaster
never would have occurred had his system been in
effect last April, for he declares that the <i>Titanic's</i>
captain would have known of the iceberg he was approaching
long enough in advance to slacken speed
and get out of its way. Moreover, he declares that
with the wireless transmission of power, the wireless
telegraph becomes a very simple matter, and that
immediately after the accident, had the ship struck
an obstacle in spite of warnings, the captain could
have been in wireless telephone communication with
his offices in London and New York, and with all
the ships that were on the seas in the vicinity of the
ill-fated liner.</p>

<p>But making air and sea navigation safe, sure, and
speedy, are only the first steps Tesla intends to take
in the wireless transmission of power. After that
he hopes to light the earth&mdash;to carry a beautiful
soft bright light to ranchmen far out on the deserts,
to miners in their cabins or deep in the earth, to
farmers, and to sailors, as well as to people in their
homes in the cities all over the world&mdash;Australia
as well as the United States.</p>

<p>Wireless electrical power, according to Tesla,
will be one of the greatest agencies in war, if there
is any, but it first will be an argument for universal
peace. "Fights," says the inventor, "whether between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
individuals or between nations arise from misunderstandings,
and with the complete dissemination
of intelligence, constant communication, and familiarity
with the ideals of other nations, that international
combativeness so dangerous to world peace,
will disappear."</p>

<p>If Tesla's plan were carried out in full it would
completely revolutionize the industries of the world,
for all the power of Niagara or any other waterfall
in the world could be sent without wires to turn the
wheels of the industries in China or Australia, while
the power of the Zambesi Falls in Africa could be
transmitted to run trains, subways, elevateds, and
all other forms of industry in the United States.
There is practically no limit to the possibilities of the
scheme, because through Tesla's invention, distance
means nothing, and the power instead of losing force
with distance as is the case when power is transmitted
through wires, retains practically the same voltage
as at the outset.</p>

<p>We will visit Doctor Tesla at his office and laboratory
in the Metropolitan Tower in New York with
the scientist and his young friend to see what kind
of a man it is who has invented machines for creating
and handling such tremendous voltages.</p>

<p>Tesla sits at a wide flat-topped desk in the centre
of his sunny office surrounded by books, a few models
of inventions, and a few pictures of some of his most
remarkable electrical experiments. He is very tall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
and slight, with a mass of black hair thrown back
from his intellectual forehead. His piercing gray
eyes sparkle as he smiles in greeting, and his thin
pointed face lights up with an expression of pleasure
and kindness that cannot help but make the great
electrician's visitors feel that he is a good friend.
Although he was naturalized more than twenty years
ago, and has been an American citizen ever since,
his English still shows some slight traces of his foreign
birth. He looks no more than forty-odd and he is
as interested in everything that is going on in the
world as a young boy, but he has passed his fiftieth
year.</p>

<p>"For all that I am something of a boy still
myself," says the inventor. "You see I could work
for the present generation to make money. Of course
that's all right, but I don't care what the present
generation thinks of me. It is the growing generation&mdash;the
boys of to-day that I want to work for,
because they will live in an age when the world has
advanced far enough in science to understand some
of the deeper mysteries of electricity. The boys
of to-day are the great scientists of to-morrow, and
it is to them that I dedicate my greatest efforts."</p>

<p>All his life Tesla has been working with an eye
to the future as well as to the present, and some
of his inventions probably will be far better appreciated
in twenty years than they are now, although
to Tesla we owe our thanks for some of the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
important electrical machinery in use at the present
time.</p>

<p>As an inventor Tesla is best known as a pioneer
in high tension currents. It was he who
introduced to the world the great principle of the
alternating current, as up to the time he carried
out his experiments only the direct current was used.
Indeed, more than four million horsepower of waterfalls
are harnessed by Tesla's alternating current
system. That is the same as forty millions of untiring
men working without pay, consuming no
food, shelter or raiment while labouring to provide
for our wants. In these days of conservation, it
is interesting to note that this electrical energy
derived from water power saves a hundred million tons
of coal every year. Our trolley roads, our subways,
many of our electrified railroads, the incandescent
lamps in our homes and offices, all use a system of
power transmission of this man's invention.</p>

<p>As said before Tesla is a naturalized American
citizen. He was born in Smiljan, Lika, on the
Austro-Hungarian border, in 1857. He came by his
scientific and inventive turn of mind naturally, for
his father was an intellectual Greek clergyman, and
his mother, Georgia Mandic, was an inventor herself
as was her father before her. The boy attended the
public schools of Lika and Croatia, where he was a
leader among his playmates in sports where imagination
and mechanical skill were required. There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
marvellous tales of the ingenuity of Tesla while
a schoolboy, but with all his play he was a serious-minded
student, and went through the Polytechnic in
Gratz and the University of Prague in Bohemia with
honours. While in the Polytechnic, Tesla saw the
defects of some of the machinery that was used in
the laboratory, and made suggestions for its improvement.</p>

<p>After finishing college Tesla began his practical
career in Budapest as an electrical engineer in 1881.
His first invention followed soon after in the form
of a telephone repeater. He continued in electrical
engineering in Paris until 1884, when he came to the
United States. His first employment in America
was with The Edison Company at Orange, N. J.,
but in 1887 he went into business for himself as an
electrical engineer. From that time on he has been
an important figure in the scientific world. He has
made many addresses before various gatherings of
experts and has written numerous papers on scientific
subjects for the magazines. Of course the bulk of
his time has been given to his inventions and the
necessary research therefor.</p>

<p>DOCTOR TESLA'S FIRST POWER PLANT</p>
<p>From this oscillator Doctor Tesla sends out the electrical
waves with which he hopes to revolutionize industry.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Throughout his life Tesla has been more interested
in the adventurous and scientific side of electricity
than the commercial side, and all of his inventions
smack of the marvellous. To name all his inventions
would be almost like giving a list of the machines and
devices that mark man's progress in the use of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
electricity. His invention for the alternating current
dynamo, for instance, brought forth an entirely new
principle, while his rotating magnetic field made
possible the transmission of alternating currents
from large power plants over great distances and is
very extensively used to-day. High power dynamos,
transformers, induction coils, oscillators, and various
kinds of electric lamps all came in for his attention.</p>

<p>He became one of the foremost authorities on high
tension currents and in 1889 invented a system of
electrical conversion and distribution by oscillatory
discharges which was a step toward his great goal,
the wireless transmission of power. He was very
near the prize when in 1893 he announced a system
of wireless transmission of intelligence. His studies
continued and finally, in 1897, he announced his
famous high potential transmitter by which he
claimed to be able to send power through the earth
without wires. The art of telautomatics announced
in 1899 was really a part of Tesla's invention for
the wireless transmission of power, for the plan was
to control such objects, for instance, as airships or
boats, from a distance by electricity transmitted without
wires.</p>

<p>Through that marvellous invention the boat or
aeroplane dispatcher, sitting before a complex little
wireless dispatching board could send his craft, at
any speed, at any height, in perfect safety, and with
exact precision to the place or port he desired it to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
go. It would not be necessary for the dispatcher
ever to see the craft he was directing, for his instruments
would show him everything in regard to its
speed, direction, and location; nor yet would it be
necessary for a craft to have a crew aboard, for
all the operations in connection with sending
it from one place to another would be controlled
perfectly by telautomatics.</p>

<p>Such are the almost inconceivable inventions of
Nikola Tesla. "Sometimes they call me a dreamer,"
says Tesla, "because I do not capitalize these inventions,
start in manufacturing and make a big
fortune. That is not what I care to do. I want
to go further in this great mystery of wireless power,
and if I am busy making money I cannot devote my
best abilities to inventions that will be in use when
the next generation is grown."</p>

<p>But let us try to fathom the mysteries of Tesla's
scheme for the transmission of electric energy without
wires. In the first place we must not try to
think of it as being on the same basis as the radio,
or Hertzian wireless telegraph, for, although the
modern developments of the wireless telegraph take
into consideration the central theory of Tesla's invention,
they are not at all the same in their practical
working.</p>

<p>Tesla's theory is based entirely on his discovery
of what he calls stationary electrical earth
waves which he sets in motion with his high potential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
magnifying transmitter, an electrical apparatus of
tremendous power.</p>

<p>First, let us remember the three essential departments
of Tesla's idea for world telegraphy, world
telephony, and world transmission of power for
commercial purposes.</p>

<p>Assuming that the power is created by Niagara
or some other great waterfall&mdash;"white coal" as it
is picturesquely called by many engineers&mdash;the
first necessities are a transformer and a transmitter
that will send the electrical energy, thus gathered,
into the earth and air. The next necessity is a receiving
instrument that will record the impulse,
whether it be a voice, a telegraph click, or several
million volts for driving factory wheels or lighting
houses. Lastly, it is necessary to tune the currents
so that millions of different impulses can be sent
without causing confusion between them. In other
words, there must be departments for sending, receiving
and "individualizing."</p>

<p>To ask Doctor Tesla to tell us the whole story of
this invention would be to ask him to tell us in detail
the whole history of his life work&mdash;and that would
take several volumes, for he is one of those men who
have worked incessantly, day and night, sacrificing
himself and overcoming his natural desire for leisure
and amusement. It all started, Tesla explains, when
he was a very small boy. He was troubled at
that time with a strange habit. Whenever any one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
would mention a thing to him, a vision of the object
immediately would come before his eyes. He declares
that this was very troublesome, and that as
he grew older he tried to overcome it, thinking it
some strange malady. With an effort he learned
how to banish the images by putting them from
his mind. On inquiring into the cause of the visions,
the young scientist's penetrating brain brought
him to the conclusion that every time he saw a
vision, some time previous he had seen something
to remind him of the object. The tracing back
of the cause of his vision so frequently caused it
to become a mental habit, and he declares that for
many years he has done it automatically, and that he
has been able to trace the cause of nearly every
impression, even including his dreams. Reflecting
on these things, as a mature scientist, Tesla
came to the conclusion that he was an automaton,
responding automatically to impressions registered
on his senses from the outside.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't I make a mechanical automaton that
would represent me in every way, except thought?"
he asked himself. The answer to the question which
came only after years of study and experiment was
the art of "telautomatics," which Tesla declares
can be developed just as soon as the wireless transmission
of power is an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>In the course of his research into the realm of high
tension currents Tesla reached the stage where it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
was no longer safe nor convenient to experiment in
the centres of population. Moreover, he desired to
make a study of the action of lightning. Colorado,
with its vast stretches of uninhabited plains and
mountains, offered an ideal place for his laboratory,
particularly because the high, dry climate of that
state brings forth some of the worst electrical
storms seen in the United States. Consequently,
in the spring of 1899, Tesla built an experiment
station on the plateau that extends from the front
range of the Rocky Mountains to Colorado Springs,
and began the experiments through which the secret
with which he hopes to revolutionize the communication
and transportation systems of the world, was
revealed to him.</p>

<p>Besides his high power alternating current dynamo,
Tesla set up an electrical oscillator with which he
hoped to send out electrical waves, through the earth
and air, that would prove to him the possibility of an
extensive system of wireless communication, and
telautomatic, or wireless control of airships, projectiles,
steamships, etc. In his early experiments he used
the oscillator at low tension, but as his success became
more marked he increased the tension, until the
oscillator was giving twelve million volts, and the
current was alternating a hundred thousand times
a second.</p>

<p>In regard to these high tension experiments in
Colorado and elsewhere, Doctor Tesla said, "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
have produced electrical oscillations which were of
such intensity that when circulating through my
arms and chest they have melted wires which have
joined my hands, and still I have felt no inconvenience.
I have energized, with such oscillations, a loop
of heavy copper wire so powerfully that masses of
metal placed within the loop were heated to a high
temperature and melted, often with the violence of
an explosion. And yet, into this space in which this
terribly destructive turmoil was going on I have
repeatedly thrust my head without feeling anything
or experiencing injurious after effects."</p>

<p>Among the earlier experiments, which in themselves
were wonderful enough, were the transmission
of an electrical current through one wire without
return, to light several incandescent lamps. Advancing
further along the trail of wireless transmission
of power, Tesla lighted the lamps without any wire
connection between them and his transmitter.</p>

<p>The oscillator, though simple in its construction,
is one of the most wonderful of all electrical devices.
"You see," said Doctor Tesla, "all that is necessary
is a high power alternating dynamo which
generates a tremendous alternating current. For
our oscillator proper, we make a few turns of a
stout cable around a cylindrical or drum-shaped form,
and connect its two ends with the source of electrical
energy. Then, inside the big cable, or primary coil, we
wind a lighter wire in spiral form. One end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
secondary coil is sunk into the ground and connected
with a plate, and the other is erected in the air.
When the current is turned on, our oscillator sends
these electrical impulses into the earth and air&mdash;or,
as the scientists say, into the natural media. These
oscillations create electrical waves and affect any
device that is tuned to them&mdash;but (and this is very
important) no device that is not tuned to them."</p>

<p>Continuing the explanation of his high tension
experiments, Tesla tells us that the awe-inspiring
electrical display, of which there is a picture on page
<a href="#Page_136">136</a>, was made by his oscillator which created an
alternate movement of electricity from the earth
into a hollow metal reservoir and back at a speed
of 100,000 alternations a second. The reservoir is
already filled to overflowing with electricity and as
the current is sent back to it at each alternation the
terrific force makes it burst forth with a deafening
roar, as great as the heaviest lightning detonation.
The electric flames shoot out in every direction
searching for something on which they may alight,
just as lightning sent from the clouds searches for
a conductor upon which it may alight and escape
into the earth. The induction coils in the picture
are tuned to these tremendous electrical explosions,
and the flames shoot direct to them, a distance of
22 feet.</p>

<p>The flames shooting from the coil of the oscillator
pictured on page <a href="#Page_164">164</a> were nearly 70 feet across,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
represented twelve million volts of electricity, and
a current alternating 130,000 times a second. These
hair-raising experiments created such electrical
disturbances that it was possible to draw great
sparks more than an inch long, from water plugs
over 300 feet from the laboratory. One of the most
marvellous things about these experiments is that
any human being could remain in the vicinity. The
absolute safety of these discharges when properly
harnessed is well illustrated in the picture shown
there as the man seen amidst the flames felt no ill
effects from his experience, simply because this power
was so thoroughly harnessed by the wizard Tesla,
that it could go only to the device tuned to receive
it. Every boy is familiar with stories of lightning
striking one person, but yet leaving another person
right next to him unharmed. Such is the action
of Tesla's high tension currents, only he directs them
by induction just as he wants them to go.</p>

<p>"But this is just like lightning!" exclaimed the
boy.</p>

<p>"So it is," calmly answered Doctor Tesla with a
smile. "I have often produced electrical oscillations
even greater than the energy of lightning discharges."</p>

<p>These experiments were marvellous enough, but
they were surpassed in a short time by his famous
discovery of July 3, 1899, which showed him that he
could send his wireless waves to the opposite side
of the earth just as well as a hundred feet away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
This revelation, as the scientist calls it, came about
through his study of lightning. The scientist had
set up in his Colorado laboratory many delicate
electrical instruments to register various different
electrical effects. Tesla noticed, however, that
strangely enough his instruments were just as
violently affected by distant electrical storms as by
nearby disturbances.</p>

<p>"One night when meditating over these facts,"
said Tesla, "I was suddenly staggered by a thought.
The same thing had presented itself to me years ago;
but I had then dismissed it as impossible. And that
night when it recurred to me I banished it again.
Nevertheless, my instinct was aroused, and somehow
I felt that I was nearing a great revelation.</p>

<p>"As you know, it was on the third of July that I
obtained the first definite evidence of a truth of
overwhelming importance for the advancement of
humanity. A dense mass of strongly charged clouds
gathered in the west, and toward evening a violent
storm broke loose which, after spending much of its
fury in the mountains, was driven away with great
velocity over the plains. Heavy and long persisting
arcs formed almost at regular intervals of time. My
observations were now greatly facilitated and rendered
more accurate by the records already made. I
was able to handle my instruments quickly, and was
prepared. The recording apparatus being properly
adjusted, its indications became fainter and fainter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
with the increasing distance of the storm, until they
ceased altogether. I was watching in eager expectation.
Sure enough, in a little while the indications
again began, grew stronger, gradually decreased, and
ceased once more. Many times, in regularly recurring
intervals, the same actions were repeated, until
the storm, as evident from simple computations, with
nearly constant speed had retreated to a distance
of about two hundred miles. Nor did these strange
actions stop then, but continued to manifest themselves
with undiminished force.</p>

<p>"When I made this discovery I was utterly
astounded. I could not believe what I had seen was
really true. It was too great a revelation of Nature
to accept immediately and unhesitatingly."</p>

<p>What Tesla had discovered, and soon announced
to the scientific world, was the existence of stationary
terrestrial waves of electricity, and its meaning was
that an impulse sent into the earth was carried on
these waves to the other side of the earth and rebounded
without any loss of power. He had, in
fact, discovered and turned to man's use the very
heartbeats of our earth.</p>

<p>"Whatever electricity may be," he continued, "it
is a fact that it acts like a fluid, and in this connection,
we may consider the earth as a great hollow ball
filled with electricity." He goes on to explain that
when an impulse is sent into this ball of electricity
it proceeds to the opposite wall of the earth in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
waves and, finding no outlet it returns to the place
it started, but in a series of waves exactly the
opposite of the outgoing ones, so that the two cross
and diverge at regular intervals as indicated in the
diagram.</p>

<div><a name="diagram_of_the_earth" id="diagram_of_the_earth"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_b_147.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>A&mdash;Oscillator &ensp;B&mdash;Opposite side of
earth &ensp;C&mdash;Waves in nodal and
ventral intervals.</p>
</div></div>

<p>As Tesla put it, "The outgoing and returning
currents clash and form nodes and loops similar to
those observable on a vibrating cord." Tesla figured
from these experiments that the waves varied from
25 to 70 kilometres from node to node, that they
could be sent to any part of the globe, and that they
could be sent in varying lengths up to the extreme
diameter of the earth.</p>

<p>In order to prove his discovery Tesla sent an
impulse into the earth, and received it back, on his
delicate instrument, in a few seconds. "It is like
an echo," he explained. "When you shout and in
a few seconds hear your voice coming back, you do
not think it is another voice but know immediately
that it is simply your own vocal vibrations reflected
by the house, mountainside, or what not. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
just the same with an electrical vibration. The
stationary terrestrial wave goes through the earth,
reaches the other side and, finding no outlet, is reflected
without any loss of power. Indeed, in some
cases it is returned with greater power than at first."</p>

<p>"Then in your system the wireless electrical
current passes through the earth, and not through
the air," interrupted the scientist.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, "it passes through both. It
is difficult to understand the big things about electricity,
but just think of the earth as a great ball
filled with electricity, as I said before. Think of the
tower of the oscillator as a tube, and of the great
mushroom-shaped top of the plant as another ball.
Now from our great alternating current dynamo we
first fill the ball at the top of the oscillator with electricity,
and then we make a motion that corresponds to
squeezing it. What happens? Just what happens
when you have two rubber balls connected with a tube.
You squeeze one of them, and push the air, or water,
into the other ball. In that way we push the electricity
into the earth, but it comes back to us on the
stationary waves, from the opposite side, and when
it does we are ready to give it another mighty push
with another tremendous squeeze from our dynamo.
When this is going on the top of the oscillator is
gathering electricity from the air all the time and
sending it out to be used wherever there is a receiver
properly tuned to receive these rates of vibration."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
"But," again asked our friend, "isn't there a great
deal of valuable electrical power wasted in that way?"</p>

<p>"No, there is very little waste," answered the
electrician, "for this reason: If, for instance, our
oscillator can generate a hundred thousand or a
million, or any other number of volts, and we only
wish to use it for some small purpose on the other
side of the earth, the receiver at the antipodes takes
as much power as is needed, and the rest remains
unused and our oscillator can be run at reduced
capacity."</p>

<p>Thus, according to Tesla's plan, the electrical
energy will be sent into the earth and air by the high
potential magnifying transmitter or oscillator, the
stationary electrical waves carry it through the earth
and the receiving instrument on the other side of the
world collects the energy to put it to a thousand and
one purposes of mankind. And do not forget that
the oscillator and the receiving instrument are so
tuned to each other that there is no danger, according
to Tesla's scheme, of different oscillators and receivers
getting mixed up.</p>

<p>Before Tesla had discovered the stationary electrical
waves he had gone deep into the mystery of the
"individualization" of electrical impulses, and as a
result advanced plans for sending a number of
messages over one wire without their interfering
with each other. This study was continued with
even greater energy, after he had taken the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
steps toward the realization of his world telegraphy
and world telephony without wires. In wireless
telegraphy as we know its practice to-day, one of
the serious drawbacks is the interference of other
operators, both amateur and professional, with important
messages. Tesla holds that the simple tuning
of instruments to one another as is done nowadays
would not be sufficient, when there were millions
of currents passing through and around the earth.
For instance, he says that an instrument tuned to
a single rate of vibrations would be very apt to come
into contact with another instrument sending at the
same rate. Of course the confusion so familiar in
modern radio-telegraphy would result. Moreover,
it makes it difficult to send messages that cannot
be intercepted and read by every wireless operator
in hearing. "This can be avoided," continues the
inventor, "by combining different tones or rates of
vibration. In actual practice it is found that by
combining only two tones, a degree of privacy
sufficient for most purposes is attained. When three
vibrations are combined it is extremely difficult even
for a skilled expert to read or disturb signals not
intended for him. It is vain to undertake to 'cut
in on' a series of wireless impulses made up of four
different rates of vibration. The probability of getting
the secret of the combination is as slight as
of your solving the number combination on the door
of a safe. From experiments I have concluded that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
this individualization will allow the transmission
of several million different messages. It is interesting
when you think that one world telegraphy
plant would have a greater capacity than all the
ocean cables combined."</p>

<p>In regard to the amount of power to be transmitted,
Tesla points out that an impulse of low voltage, or
low horsepower, will carry to the other side of the
earth without any loss of power, just as easily as a
high voltage current. "A wire," says Tesla, "offers
certain resistance to an electrical current causing
some loss, but not so when it is sent through the
natural media. The earth is a conducting body of
such enormous dimensions that there is virtually
no loss, so that distance means nothing. To the
average intelligence this will appear incomprehensible.
We are continuously confronted with limitations,
and those truths which are contradicted by our
senses are the hardest to grasp. For example, one
of the most difficult tasks was to satisfy the human
mind that the earth rotated round the sun; for to
the eye it seemed just the opposite."</p>

<p>Tesla further pointed out that five-hundred miles
is about the farthest that high power can be transmitted
by wires with complete success, but that
without wires, by his system, power can be transmitted,
as we have seen, to any part of the globe
or the atmosphere about it.</p>

<p>The plan for a world-wide system of wireless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
telegraphs and telephones differs considerably from
the original idea laid down by scientists for radio or
Hertzian wireless telegraphy. Originally Guglielmo
Marconi, who first successfully telegraphed without
wires, and whose system is well known all over the
world, planned to send his electrical impulses through
the ether, in the form of Hertzian rays, but later
the method was amended. The theory advanced
was that since everything is afloat in the colourless,
intangible something called ether (not the drug used
as an an√¶sthetic), and that since waves of light, heat,
and electricity travel through ether, it would be
possible to send electrical impulses through the ether
in the earth and air, just as well as through the ether
in a copper wire. In his early experiments Marconi
used the light rays or waves named after their discoverer,
Hertz, but these were found to be very
limited, so electrical vibrations of a higher intensity
were substituted, as we shall see in a later chapter.</p>

<p>"From the very first," declared Tesla, "my system
has been based on a different principle, as you can
see from what I have told you. For instance, my invention
takes no consideration of light rays in any
visible or invisible form (and Hertzian rays are invisible
light), which can only travel in a straight line.
Hence, you can see that they could not be used except
as far as could be seen. In other words, they only
could be used as far as the horizon, for just as soon as
the curve of the earth's surface took the receiving instrument
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
below the level of the Hertzian waves they
became ineffective. You see the difference is that
my system is based on the stationary earth waves,
along which the electrical currents can pass to any
distance irrespective of horizon, or matter."</p>

<p>A simple explanation will serve to show the principle
of Tesla's theory of wireless telegraphy and
telephony. We can easily think of a reservoir with
two openings in the cover filled with some fluid. In
each of these openings is a piston and above each
piston is a tuning fork. The two tuning forks must
be of exactly the same tone or the experiment will
not work. We strike one of the pistons with the
tuning fork, and continue to strike it until the fork
sets up vibrations. The vibrations pass through the
air, and also communicate vibrations to the piston,
which in turn passes the vibrations on to the fluid in
the reservoir. These vibrations naturally continue
through the reservoir, as waves, just the same as
when we throw a pebble into a calm pond and watch
the waves radiate out in every direction. The water
does not advance, but merely moves up and down.
The waves, however, advance. So with the waves set
up by the tuning fork, and they set up an oscillation
of the piston at the other side, agitating the tuning
fork in unison with the sound vibrations coming
through the air.</p>

<p>It is just the same, declares Tesla, with two of his
oscillators set up on the earth's surface and tapping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
the great sea of electricity, which he says is in the
earth. The oscillators correspond to the tuning
forks, the reservoir to the earth, and the fluid in the
reservoir to the electrical currents with which he
says the interior of the earth is alive. Exactly
attuned, Tesla says, the vibrations set up by the
sender will be communicated to the receiver through
the earth and through the air.</p>

<p>"Now, with the development of the world system,"
continued Tesla, "we shall be able to telephone
without wires just as well as telegraph, and to any
part of the world just as easily as we now talk to a
friend in an adjoining house over the modern wire
circuits."</p>

<p>Before going with Doctor Tesla to his great plant
out on Long Island to see how he is carrying on these
tremendous theories of his, the boy asked him a few
more questions about them, for it is a big and intricate
question.</p>

<p>"What application will you first make of the wireless
transmission of power?"</p>

<p>"My first concern," replied the magician of electricity,
"will be to make air and water navigation safe.
We have plenty of demonstrations of the value of
the wireless telegraph in saving human lives when
ships are in danger, in the <i>Republic</i> and <i>Titanic</i>
disasters. But also we know that the wireless can
be greatly improved upon. With a perfect system
of communication, both by wireless telegraph and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
telephone, consider what it would mean to the
navigators of air and ocean craft.</p>

<p>"By the art of telautomatics, which is a part of the
broad scheme for the wireless transmission of power,
many of the worst dangers of air and water navigation
will be avoided, which is right in line with the
modern tendency of preventing trouble rather than
waiting for it to happen before remedying it." He
then went on to enumerate the various telautomatic
devices that will be carried by ocean liners and airships
of the future, as mentioned in the early part of
this chapter.</p>

<p>"Just for instance, how could telautomatics have
saved the <i>Titanic</i>?" the inventor was asked.</p>

<p>"You understand, of course," answered Tesla,
"that the devices I propose would be of almost
inconceivable sensitiveness. They would be the
centre of electrical waves, and, as soon as the iceberg
got into the path of these waves from the wireless
transmission plant to the ship, it would cause the
electricity to register an impression of danger ahead.
Of course mariners would become so expert in the
reading of these danger signals that they could tell
the meaning of each one, and alter their course or
reverse their engines according to the needs of the
case."</p>

<p>"How much have you accomplished in telautomatics
at this time?"</p>

<p>"I have made a little submarine boat that will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
answer to every necessary impulse. The boat contained
its own motive power in a storage battery and
gear for propulsion, steering sidewise, or upward or
downward, and all other accessories necessary for
its operation. All of these were worked from a
distance by wireless impulses, sent by an oscillator
to the circuit in the boat through which magnets and
other devices operated the interior mechanism.</p>

<p>"This proved to me the possibility of a high
development of telautomatics. When my system
is complete, a crewless ship may be sent from any
port in the world to any other port propelled by
wireless energy from a power plant anywhere on the
face of the earth, and controlled absolutely by telautomatics."</p>

<p>Tesla's plan for aerial navigation is even more
startling than that for crewless ocean liners. He
thinks that the airships of the future will be propelled
by wireless power and that they will have, neither
planes nor other supporting surfaces, such as we are
so familiar with nowadays. Neither will they be
supported by gas bags like balloons and dirigibles.
The inventor thinks they will be compact and just as
airworthy as ocean liners are seaworthy. They will be
tightly enclosed, so that the terrific rush of air through
the high altitudes will not strangle the passengers
and crew. He sees no reason why the airships of
the future should not travel at a rate of several
hundred miles an hour, so that you could leave San
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Francisco in the morning and be in New York in
time for a six o'clock dinner, and the theatre, or
cross the Atlantic in a night.</p>

<p>"How will these airships be propelled?" the boy
asked.</p>

<p>"By engines driven with power supplied by our
great oscillator wherever we care to erect it. These
engines will work with such incredible force that
they will make of the air above them a veritable rope
to sustain them at any desired altitude, while they
will make of the air in front of them a rope to pull
them forward at a high rate of speed." Tesla continues
to say that these ships can be made just as
large as it is practicable to make their landing stages,
or small enough for one or two passengers.</p>

<p>In the waterfalls of the United States alone, he
pointed out, there are twenty-five hundred million
horsepower of electrical energy. Niagara Falls could
supply more than one fifth of all the power now used
in this country, he says. Moreover, none of the great
sites, such as those in the far Northwest, are developed
to their highest state, because of the difficulty in
transmitting the power over long distances to where
it is used.</p>

<p>"It must be borne in mind," said Tesla, "that
electrical energy obtained by harnessing a waterfall
is probably fifty times more effective than fuel energy.
Since this is the most perfect way of rendering the
sun's energy available the direction of the future
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
material development of man is clearly indicated.
He will live on 'white coal.'"</p>

<p>"Doctor Tesla, can you tell us, please, just how
far you have developed this invention for the wireless
transmission of power?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered the electrical inventor, "the
best way to tell you is to show you what has been
done so far." In order to see Tesla's great plant
we must follow the scientist and his boy friend out
to Bay Shore, L. I., where, overlooking Long Island
Sound, we see a great mushroom-shaped steel network
tower surmounting a low building&mdash;the first of
Tesla's many proposed high potential magnifying
transmitters.</p>

<p>"So far," said Tesla of his power plant where the
first attempts at wireless transmission are being
made, "only about three million horsepower has
been harnessed by my system of alternating current
transmission. This is little, but it corresponds nevertheless
to adding to the world's population sixty
million indefatigable laborers, working virtually without
food or pay."</p>

<p>As the boy approached the power plant he was
impressed by the great size of the tower and its
circular top, as shown in the photograph. It is
this circular top, with its conductive apparatus,
that gathers the electricity from the air and
from the dynamo, and sends it forth in great
waves both through the air and through the earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
The tower is 185 feet high, from the ground to the
top, and from the ground to the edge of the cupola
it is 153 feet. The diameter of the cupola floor is 65
feet. The cupola can be reached by both a staircase
and an elevator, but it would hardly be healthy for
any one to be within the network of electrical conductors
when the plant was working. Inside the
building are the high power alternating dynamos
and underneath it extends the ground wire from the
cupola, through which the electricity is pumped into
the ground in great spurts at the rate of more than
a hundred thousand spurts a second. At this plant
Tesla plans to gather and concentrate millions of
horsepower of electrical energy and then, in the ways
we have seen, send it out to be used in a thousand
different ways.</p>

<p>"This is merely an experiment," declared Tesla.
"We can telegraph and carry on other such operations
as require only a small amount of power from here,
but it is nothing compared to the great power plants
we will erect in the future."</p>

<p>"Is it necessary," asked the boy, "to have your
power plant erected near the waterfall, or other
means of producing the electricity?"</p>

<p>"No, it is not. This plant, for instance, can be
made a great receiving station for electric power
from all the great hydro-electric sites, and from it we
hope to be able to send out electrical waves that will
run our ships, airships, trains and street cars, carry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
our voices, light our houses, and turn the wheels
of our factories. It is better, however, to have the
plants located close to the seats of power, and to have
a greater number of plants."</p>

<p>"How much horsepower did you say this plant
would send out?"</p>

<p>"Only a mere trifle of three million horsepower,
but of course this is only an experiment. To be
done properly the thing must be done on a large
scale, and the time will come&mdash;not necessarily
remote&mdash;when we will be carrying on the whole
programe embraced by the wireless transmission of
power. The cost of wireless power I estimate would
be about one sixteenth of that of the present system."</p>

<p>"When you are sending such tremendous voltages
won't it be very dangerous to be anywhere in the
vicinity of a plant, much less anywhere that the
electricity might be brought from the earth?"</p>

<p>"No, for the power is so well harnessed that we
can send it just where we want it and nowhere else.
Of course, on the other hand, if we wanted to make
trouble with this well-harnessed lightning we could
make a terrible disturbance in the earth and on the
surface of the earth."</p>

<p>"What about lightning?"</p>

<p>"That is one of the things we had to guard against
right from the very first, and I can tell you that
lightning will not bother us a bit, although I cannot
give you the details of our method of avoiding it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
"When we are using the plant at night, however,
there will be a display far more beautiful than
lightning, all about the cupola in the form of
a great halo of electric light visible for miles
around."</p>

<p>Before we leave this fascinating subject of the wireless
transmission of power let us ask Doctor Tesla
about the effect of his invention on war.</p>

<p>"The wireless transmission of power will first be a big
factor in promoting world peace, as I said before, because
through the great improvement in communication
it will lead to a better understanding between
nations and break down many of the old prejudices
that have lived for so many thousands of years. It
will facilitate travel and commerce so that a citizen
of the United States will find it as simple and cheap to
travel abroad as he now finds it to travel in the
neighbouring state. His commercial interests also
will spread to foreign countries, and the nations
will be so linked with one another socially and commercially
that war will be out of the question.</p>

<p>"However, in case war should break out between
the nations it will be a conflict of such gigantic
proportions, and carried on with such tremendous
death-dealing machines, that it will surpass our
wildest dreams.</p>

<p>"For one thing, the new art of controlling electrically
the movements and operations of individualized
automata at a distance without wires will soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
enable any country to render its coast impregnable
against all naval attacks.</p>

<p>"I have invented a number of improvements of
this plan, making it possible to direct a telautomaton
torpedo, submersible at will, from a distance much
greater than the range of the largest gun, with
unerring precision, upon the object to be destroyed.
What is still more surprising, the operator will not
need to see the infernal engine or even know its
location, and the enemy will be unable to interfere,
in the slightest, with its movements by any electrical
means. One of these devil-telautomata will soon be
constructed, and I shall bring it to the attention of
governments. The development of this art must
unavoidably arrest the construction of expensive
battleships as well as land fortifications, and revolutionize
the means and methods of warfare. The
distance at which it can strike, and the destructive
power of such a quasi-intelligent machine being for
all practical purposes unlimited, the gun, the armour
of the battleship, and the wall of the fortress, lose
their import and significance. One can prophesy
with a Daniel's confidence that skilled electricians
will settle the battles of the near future, if battles
we must have.</p>

<p>"The future of wireless power development," explained
the inventor, "may render it folly for any
nation to have afloat a vessel of war. The secret
of another nation's scheme of selectivity or combination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
of vibrations might be disclosed to the enemy,
when the guns of their own vessels might be turned
against sister ships and a whole fleet destroyed by
shells from their own guns, or their magazines might
be exploded by the enemy at will. However, should
there be battleships in the wireless future, they will
be crewless. They will be man&oelig;uvred, their guns
will be loaded, aimed, and fired, and their torpedoes
discharged with unerring accuracy, by the director
of naval warfare seated before a telautomatic switch-board
on land.</p>

<p>"The time will come, as a result of my discovery,"
says Tesla, "when one nation may destroy another
in time of war through this wireless force: great
tongues of electric flame made to burst from the
earth of the enemy's country might destroy not only
the people and the cities, but the land itself. I realize
that this is indeed a dangerous thing to advocate.
At first thought it might mean the annihilation of
the nations of the world by evilly disposed individuals.
The public might at first look upon the perfection
of such an invention as a calamity. We say
that all inventions assist the criminal in his work.
To-day the safe burglar despises the use of dynamite,
turning to electrical contrivances to cut the lock from
a safe. It is fortunate for the world, therefore, that
90 per cent. of its people are good, and that only 10
per cent. are evilly disposed: otherwise all invention
might be turned more greatly to evil than to good."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
THE MOTION-PICTURE MACHINE</h2>
</div>

<p class="hanging">MACHINES THAT MAKE SIXTEEN TINY PICTURES PER
SECOND AND SHOW THEM AT THE SAME RATE
MAGNIFIED SEVERAL THOUSAND TIMES&mdash;MOTION
PICTURES IN SCHOOL&mdash;OUR BOY FRIEND SEES THE
WHOLE PROCESS OF MAKING A MOTION-PICTURE PLAY.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">"I</span>HAVE just been to the moving-picture show,"
said the young man whose inquiring turn of mind
has brought him into touch with so many recent
inventions. His friend in the laboratory had just
finished a very successful chemical experiment and
seemed glad to see the boy.</p>

<p>"Did the pictures move very much?" he asked
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Of course they did. They moved all the time."</p>

<p>"No, they only seemed to move, for as a matter
of fact there are no such things as 'moving pictures.'
We call them 'motion pictures' now, for that comes
nearer to expressing the idea.</p>

<p>"Cinematography, which is the technical name for
the whole art of motion pictures, is based on one of
nature's defects, whereas most inventions are based
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
on some of nature's perfect processes. The defect
is called by the scientists the persistence
of vision, which means that after you look at an
object, and it is quickly taken from before your
eyes, the image remains there for the fraction of a
second.</p>

<p>The Oscillator shown on the left sending an alternating current from the earth into a large reservoir and back at

<p>A BATTLE SCENE IN THE STUDIO</p>
<p>In this picture the stage director can be seen shouting directions to both actors and photographer at once.</p>
</div></div>

<p>"With this in mind you will see how the cinematograph
is simply still photography worked out so as
to show a series of snapshots at such speed that the
eye cannot notice the change from one picture to
another, but will see only the changing positions of
the figures. Each picture shows the figures in a
little different position, in the same order that they
move, so that the whole series thrown on the screen
at high speed shows the figures moving just as they
do in real life."</p>

<p>"But where does visual persistence come in?"
asked the youth.</p>

<p>"It would be plain if you could see the pictures
thrown on the screen twenty times as slowly as they
are, for each snapshot of each stage of motion must
be displayed separately. It must remain perfectly
still for an instant and then must be moved
away while the shutter of the projecting machine is
closed. When the shutter is opened again the next
picture is thrown on the screen. Now, through the
persistence of vision, the image of the first picture
remains in your brain, photographed on the retina
of your eye, while the shutter is closed, and you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
not conscious that there is nothing on the white
screen before your eyes.</p>

<p>"The scientific explanation of this is simple enough:
After an image has been recorded by your eye it will
remain in the brain for an instant even after the
object has been removed. Then it fades slowly away
and gives place to the next image sent along the
optic nerve from the eye. Thus the eye acts as a
sort of dissolving lantern for the motion-picture man,
and lets one image fade into another without showing
any perceptible change in pictures. Thus the
'moving picture' is only a scientifically worked out
<i>illusion</i> of motion."</p>

<p>The scientist went on to say that with marvellously
constructed machines this scientific fact has been
turned to such account that boys and girls in some
of the schools now study geography partly from
motion pictures, and some of the most wonderful
sights of nature are seen every day by millions of
people as they sit comfortably in their seats in the
motion-picture theatre. A few years ago, before
the invention of cinematography, the magic lantern
was largely used, as many boys will remember; but
it could only show scenes in which there was no
movement&mdash;or in other words, scenes that were
confined to still-life photography. Nowadays every
boy is familiar with motion pictures depicting great
historical occurrences, parades, inaugurations, coronations,
volcanoes in eruption, earthquakes, buildings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
burning and crumbling, railroad wrecks, shipwrecks,
scenes in every country in the world and plays of
every imaginable kind.</p>

<p>The motion-picture photographer takes pictures in
the frozen North, and in the densest tropical jungles.
He goes close to the craters of volcanoes in eruption
to make a film of the terrifying flow of molten lava,
and he sails the seas in the worst storms, that boys
and girls who have never seen the ocean may understand
its mighty upheavals. One motion-picture
outfit was taken to the Arctic regions off the coast
of Alaska where the volcanic activity in Behring Sea
frequently causes new islands to spring from the
ocean, or old ones to sink out of sight, in an effort
to record on the motion-picture film the birth of a
new island or the death of an old one.</p>

<p>"Ever connected with scientific research, cinematography,"
said the boy's friend, "is now one of the
important branches of recording the phenomena
of nature through which great scientific discoveries
are made. Of late years we have heard much about
germs, and the science of germs called bacteriology.
A great deal has been learned about this most important
factor in the preservation of our health,
through the study of disease germs, by watching
their activities through the medium of the cinematograph.
The little parasites are photographed under
a very high power microscope and the film is cast
upon a screen in the usual way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
"Also exploring parties and parties that go into
remote places to search for additions to our store of
scientific knowledge invariably carry motion-picture
outfits. One of the most notable examples of this
was the expedition of Lieut. Robert F. Scott in his
search for the South Pole. Lieutenant Scott carried
many hundreds of feet of standard film, a good
camera, and a portable developing outfit, with which
he made pictures of the Antarctic Continent, in
order to show the world the things that he and his
men risked their lives to see.</p>

<p>"As I said before, the cinematograph is rapidly
growing as an educational force, and Thomas A.
Edison, the pioneer inventor and the leader in the
development of the cinematograph, declares that
it will in a short time completely do away with books
in the study of geography. It is already in use
in several special school and college courses, and with
the improvements in the non-inflammable film, which
will be explained later, it can be taken up far more
extensively."</p>

<p>The man went on to say that in this connection
Mr. Edison, who had been watching the schoolwork
of his own twelve-year-old son Theodore, recently
said in the magazine <i>The World To-day</i> (now <i>Hearst's
Magazine</i>):</p>

<p>"I have one of the best moving-picture photographers
in the world in Africa. I told him to land at
Cape Town, and to take everything in sight between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
there and the mouth of the Nile. His pictures will
show children what Kaffirs are and how they live.
He will show them at work, at play, and in their
homes. They will be life-size Kaffirs that will run
and skip or work right before the children's eyes.
But the Kaffirs will be but the smallest part of what
the African pictures will show. The biggest beasts
of the jungle&mdash;the elephants, lions, rhinos, and
giraffes&mdash;will be shown, not in cages, but in their
native haunts. The city of Cape Town will be
shown with its characteristic streets and its shipping.
The broad veldts over which Kruger's armies
marched will be shown just as they are, with here
and there a burgher's cottage. Every step in the
process of mining gold and diamonds will be put
upon the film. The Nile will be shown, not as a
small black line upon a map, but as a body of beautiful
blue water, alternately plunging over cataracts
and creeping through meadows to the sea. Then
will come the Pyramids, with natives and tourists
climbing them, and, lastly, the great cities of Alexandria
and Cairo. Would any child stay at home if
he knew such a treat as this was in store for him
at school? Would he ever be likely to forget what
he had learned about Africa?"</p>

<p>"Of course," continued the man in the laboratory,
"this is but an example of the use of motion pictures
in schools. Many of you boys have probably seen
them in special lectures on other subjects, for they can
be used to show how people live and work in every
part of the world and how the various commercial
products that so largely govern our lives are made."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
But the motion-picture man, he explained, is not
at all dependent upon what really happens for his
films, because if he cannot train the eye of his camera
on some occurrence that he desires to transfer to a
film, he reproduces it in a studio, spending thousands
and thousands of dollars, if necessary for actors,
scenery and stage fittings. Nothing is too difficult
for the motion-picture man, and he has never proposed
a feat so daring but what he could find plenty of
actors willing to take the necessary parts. Battles,
scenes from history, sessions of Congress, railroad
wrecks, earthquakes and hundreds of other spectacles
have been planned, staged and acted out by the
makers of cinematograph films, while, of course, all
the plays that we see on the screen are planned and
carefully rehearsed before they are photographed.</p>

<p>This all means that cinematography has become
a gigantic industry, giving employment to hundreds of
actors, photographers, and the army of men and
women engaged in making and showing the films, to
say nothing of the thousands of picture theatres that
have sprung up in every city and town in the country.</p>

<p>While the boy's friend was telling him these things
about the adventurous life of the motion-picture
man, the listener sat spellbound.</p>

<p>"I'd love to see some motion pictures made," he
said. "The machines must be wonderful."</p>

<p>"Well," answered the scientist, "we can do that,
and if you'd like we can go up to one of the motion-picture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
studios some day soon and see the whole
process from beginning to end."</p>

<p>He was as good as his word, and several days later
they were initiated into all the tricks of cinematography
at one of the biggest laboratories in the country.
We will follow them there and see what they
found out about the machines by which motion
pictures are made and shown.</p>

<p>With the fact clear in mind that cinematography
is simply a series of snapshots of figures in motion,
taken at high speed and thrown on a screen at a
similar rate so that the human eye is tricked
into sending to the brain an impression of moving
figures rather than a series of still photographs, the
various machines necessary in cinematography will
not be difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Before there can be a cinematograph play there
must be a negative film upon which the pictures are
taken, a camera to take the pictures, an apparatus
for developing them, a positive film which corresponds
to the printing paper in still photography,
upon which the pictures are printed from the negative
film, a printing machine to print the positives from
the negatives, and lastly a projecting machine to
throw the picture upon the screen in the schoolroom,
college lecture room, or theatre.</p>

<p>Every boy who is an amateur photographer is
familiar with the photographic film. Up to the
time the method for making practical cinematograph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
films was discovered in this country, scientists
vainly tried to portray motion by the use of photographic
plates, but had little success. In a very
short time after Eastman had announced the discovery
of a celluloid substance that was transparent,
strong and flexible, light, and compressible into a
small space, Edison announced a machine for showing
motion pictures.</p>

<p>The film base, or, in other words, the material
which takes the place of the glass used in glass plates,
was discovered by George Eastman in 1889, after
years of painstaking experiment with dangerous
chemicals. The base is a kind of guncotton called
by chemists pyroxylin, which is mixed in wood
alcohol. The guncotton is made by treating flax
or cotton waste with sulphuric and nitric acids. After
the guncotton and the wood alcohol have been
thoroughly stirred up, the mixture looks like a thick
syrup, but it is about as dangerous a syrup as ever
was brewed, for its ingredients are those of the most
powerful explosives. Its technical name is cellulose-nitrate.
It is poured out on a polished surface, dried,
rolled, trimmed, and after being coated with the
sensitive material that makes it valuable for photography,
is ready for delivery to the motion-picture
maker in lengths up to 400 feet.</p>

<p>THE MOTION-PICTURE PROJECTOR</p>
<p>This is the standard Edison projector from two points of view, showing
its complicated mechanism as clearly as possible.</p>
</div></div>

<p>One of the interesting points to remember about
these films is that although they are made in lengths
up to 400 feet they are all one and three eighths of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
an inch wide, and the three eighths of an inch is
given over to a margin at each side of the picture.
That leaves a width for each picture on the film of
just one inch. The height of each picture is three
quarters of an inch. Fancy a photograph one inch
by three quarters of an inch! No matter how clear
it is you could not see with the naked eye all its details,
and so it is in the cinematograph picture.
It is so clear and sharp that when put under a
good magnifying glass details that cannot be seen
by the human eye are noticed. Now fancy multiplying
the area of each little picture 2,700 times,
and think of the chance for magnifying imperfections!
And yet that is the amount that each
picture is magnified in throwing it on a screen of the
average size.</p>

<p>The films are coated with the sensitive emulsion
in two degrees. The negative films must be as
sensitive as possible to light, as they are intended to
receive the shortest possible exposure, while the
positive films, or the ones which correspond to the
print paper in still photography, are made less sensitive
to light, inasmuch as they are exposed for a
longer time in the printing machine.</p>

<p>Fireproof films are probably one of the most important
developments in the whole great motion-picture
industry, for through these, schools, colleges,
churches, lecture halls, and other public places not
fitted with the fireproof box in which the motion-picture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
operator works, can have the advantage of
cinematography.</p>

<p>It was a difficult matter to find a non-inflammable
film, for science has not yet discovered a base that
can be made without cellulose, but the base we know
to-day was treated so as to be non-explosive and
practically non-inflammable. This film base is called
cellulose-acetate, and when it is exposed to an excessive
heat, as, for instance, the beam of the motion-picture
lamp when the film is not moving, or when it
touches a flame, it melts but does not blaze up. In
the melting it gives off a heavy smoke, but there is
no serious danger from this, as there is from the
spurting flames from an exploding cellulose-nitrate
base.</p>

<p>The films are packed in metal airtight and lightproof
boxes and sent to the motion-picture firms, where
they begin a complicated and an interesting career.
The first stage is the perforating machine, through
which all films, whether negative or positive, must go.
The holes are made along the two edges of the celluloid
strips, just as shown in the picture opposite
page <a href="#Page_176">176</a>. There are sixty-four holes to the foot, on
each side of the film, and each hole is oblong-shaped, as
can be seen, with a width of about one eighth of an
inch and a depth of about one sixteenth of an inch.
This is known as the Edison Standard Gauge, and
it is observed by practically all the motion-picture
firms in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
The perforations along the edges of the films furnish
the means for drawing them through the camera,
printing machine, and projector; and as the correct
movement of the films is one of the important factors
in making good pictures, they must be absolutely
mathematically exact. A fault in perforation of even
as much as one thousandth part of an inch is apt
to cause the film to buckle in the camera or projector
and ruin the whole thing.</p>

<p>There are several different perforating machines in
use now, and all of them are claimed by their makers
to be perfect. It will not be necessary for us to take
one of these machines to pieces further than to see
that the holes along the edges of the films are punched
by hardened steel punches. The films unwind from
one bobbin, pass through the perforating device, and
wind upon another bobbin. Of course the work must
be done in absolute darkness, except for a small
ruby lamp, as the films are so sensitive to light that
any rays other than faint red would spoil them.</p>

<p>After perforation the negatives and positives are
ready for use. The negative goes to the photographer
in its light-tight metal box to be run off in
making a film of a historical scene, a comedy, some
wonderful phenomenon of science, or any one of a
million different subjects. Just for the sake of
seeing everything in its proper order we will assume
that the negative is about to be used in portraying
a comedy about the troubles of a book agent, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
that it is all done in the studio where the scientist
and his boy friend watched this very film made.</p>

<p>Now for a look into a motion-picture camera&mdash;something
few people get, because the competition
among the various cinematographers is keen, and
those who hold patents on cameras fear infringement.</p>

<p>The camera, which is enclosed in a strong mahogany
box, stands upon a tripod. It is about eighteen
inches long, eighteen inches high, and four inches
wide. (This size varies with the make, and kind
of work required.) The left side opens on a hinge,
while on the right side are the ground glass finder,
the distance gauge, and a dial to register the number
of feet of film used. In the rear of the camera is a
small hole which connects with a tube running
straight through the box so that the operator looking
through can sight it like a telescope, before the
film is exposed. When the sighting and focusing
are completed the opening is closed with a light-tight
cap, and the film can be threaded through the camera.
Having no bellows for focusing like an ordinary camera,
the lens of the motion-picture camera is moved
back and forward a short distance in the little tube
in which it is set, to aid in the focusing. Of course
the lenses of these wonderful snapshot machines are
the best that money can buy and the factories can
turn out.</p>

<p>In the rear half of the camera are two boxes. The
top one holds the unexposed roll of negative, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
the exposed film is rolled in the bottom one. Roughly
speaking, the film unwinds from the top spool,
passes out of the containing box through a slit, over
a set of sprockets into the "film gate," down past the
lens and shutter, where it is exposed over a lower
set of sprockets, and through a slit into the lower
containing box, where it is wound on a spool.</p>

<p>"It looks simple enough, doesn't it?" asked the
photographer, who was explaining the making of
a moving-picture play to his visitors. "Well, it is
a simple idea, but it takes a very complicated and
a wonderfully accurate machine to accomplish the
desired result.</p>

<p>"In the first place our cinematography is just still
photography at high speed. We have to take approximately
sixteen snapshots a second, so you can see
that it takes a perfect machine to move the film
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
along fast enough so that we can get sixteen good,
clear, sharp pictures only slightly bigger than a
postage stamp, on our film between the ticks of your
watch.</p>

<p>"Now if you look through the little hole at the
back of the camera you will see that the scene in
front of us is in the proper focus, and if you look at
the little ground glass finder at the side here you
will see it just the same way, except that it will be
upside down. Now I will close the telescope focus
at the rear so that when the film is brought down
before the lens it will not be light struck."</p>

<p>The "threading" of the camera then began. "This
little flap sticking out of this slit in the top box,"
continued the cinematographer, "is the end of the
film, which is tightly wound up in its holder. You
notice that I draw it out and thread it between these
rollers, making sure that the teeth of the sprockets
enter the perforations along the sides of the film.
I also make sure that the sensitized side of the film
is turned out, so that the light coming through the
lens will strike it first. After the negative has been
led over the sprockets you notice that it is allowed
to make a loop of a couple of inches of slack. Then
it is led into the important device we call the 'film
gate.'</p>

<p>"You see the gate is hinged and that these little
claws or fingers running in grooves take hold of the
perforations. The next thing is to close the hinged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
gate so that the film is tightly held against the
aperture, through which the light strikes it and makes
the picture. Below the gate we let the negative
make another loop and then thread it over another
system of rollers and sprockets and so to the slit
in the lower box, where the exposed negative is
rolled.</p>

<p>"The camera is now loaded and threaded and when
I give the crank by which the wheels are turned
a few trial turns you can see the way the mechanism
works. In the first place you must understand that
the film has to be jerked down with an intermittent
motion. Don't forget to look for the intermittent
motion, because, after the persistence of vision, that
jump and stop, jump and stop, is the most important
thing in cinematography&mdash;intermittent motion!</p>

<p>"You can see as the crank turns that the sprockets
pull the film out and guide it along its course, and
the little fingers jerk it down the space of one picture,
or three quarters of an inch, at each jump. When
the fingers are jerking the negative down, the shutter
must be closed, and when the fingers are making
their back trip to take a new hold on another length
of film the strip must be as still as the Washington
Monument, for the shutter to open, let in the light
and transfer the image before the lens to the negative."</p>

<p>The photographer turned his crank and all the
wheels in the camera began to move. The sprockets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
working in the perforations pulled out the film
and made the loop larger. The little fingers entered
the perforations and jerked the film down, taking
up some of the slack of the loop. The reason that
the loop is formed is to prevent the film being torn
by a hard jerk by the fingers when it is taut.</p>

<p>"Now if your eye were quick enough&mdash;which
it is not"&mdash;said the photographer, "and you could
see behind the gate, you would see a movement like
the following repeated sixteen times to the second:
Crank turns, top sprocket adds three quarters of
an inch to the top loop, bottom sprocket takes up
three quarters of an inch of bottom slack loop, fingers
spring from groove and carry film down three quarters
of an inch, inconceivably short pause while shutter
opens and picture is taken; during this pause, while
film is stationary, fingers jump back into groove, slide
back to starting point without touching film and
shutter closes. The shutter is a revolving disk
between the lens and film, and the holes in the disk
passing the negative admit the light."</p>

<p>After a roll of negative film has been exposed it is
sent to the studio dark room for development.
Every precaution is taken, of course, that no ray of
light other than that which comes from the ruby
lamp shall enter this room where films representing
hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of dollars are being
developed. The actual process for developing is
no different from that used in developing other films,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
but the difficulties in handling a delicate snakelike,
strip some 300 or 400 feet long and 1-3/8 inches wide
are tremendous. All amateur photographers appreciate
the difficulties of developing in one string
a roll of twelve films of a reasonable size, but
think of handling a roll of film several hundred
feet long no wider than a ribbon, and holding sixteen
pictures to each foot of surface!</p>

<p>The difficulties of scratching, tangling, etc., were
overcome by systematizing the process. In some
cinematograph dark rooms the films are wound on
racks about four by five feet, and then plunged into
the various baths, which are in vertical tanks of
convenient size. In yet other dark rooms the films
are wound upon drums about four feet in diameter
and revolved in horizontal tanks, only the lower
part being immersed. The only difference is that
the racks can be manipulated easier than the drums.</p>

<p>While in the motion-picture dark room the boy
visitor asked the photographer in charge whether
an amateur could step in and develop a few hundred
feet of film granted that he had the necessary
materials.</p>

<p>"Of course he could," came a cheerful voice from
the darkness. "It's just the same as developing
a roll of ordinary films, only we do more in a bunch
than the amateur. If you'll step over here and watch
this reel that we are now putting into the developing
bath you'll see that it does just the same as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
single film developed in the amateur's dark room."
After watching this trained photographer and his
assistant for a few minutes, however, the newcomer
decided that it was not an amateur's job, but rather
one of the most delicate operations in all cinematography,
for the developer can remedy many faults
of exposure by bringing out an under-exposed film
or toning down an over-exposed one.</p>

<p>Leaving the dark room the next stage of the negative
is the drying room, where the film still on the
rack is hung up to dry. This drying is a very difficult
process because there is great danger of the film
either becoming too brittle and cracking or of its being
not hard enough. The air in the drying room has
to be kept at a certain even temperature and it must
be filtered so that no dust or impurity can injure
the film.</p>

<p>After it has been properly dried the film again is
wound upon a metal spool, put in an airtight box
and sent to the assembling room, where the various
scenes that go to make up the picture play, taken
at different times and on different rolls of negative,
are joined together in their proper order to make a
complete play in a single roll about one thousand feet
long.</p>

<p>After the negative film is developed, dried and
wound upon a metal spool it is sent to the printing
room, where positive prints are made from the original
impression. Right here it may be well to say that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
on a negative film or plate in any kind of photography
white appears black and black appears white&mdash;hence
the name negative. The paper or film upon which
the print is to be made turns black wherever the
light strikes it, so that when the negative is laid
over the positive and exposed to a strong light
the rays quickly penetrate the white spots on the
negative and turn the corresponding spots on the
positive black. The light does not penetrate the
places on the negative which are black, and consequently
leaves those places on the positive white.
The result is that the positive shows the image just
as it appears to the eye.</p>

<p>The principle of printing positive films, then, is
the same as the principle of making photographic
prints or positives from ordinary still photography
plates or films, but of course it is far more complicated
because of the mechanical difficulties of bringing
the two long, unwieldy strips of film together in the
proper position. The whole process is carried out
by a machine which takes the place of the printing
frame into which the amateur so easily puts the
still-life photographic plate and printing paper.</p>

<p>There are several motion-picture printing machines
in use in this country, but in their central idea they
are similar, as they all pass the negative and positive
films before a very bright light so that the impressions
on the negative are transferred to the positive. The
invention of this machine was a necessity for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
commercial success of motion pictures, for obviously
it was impossible to lay a strip of film several hundred
feet long and about an inch wide in a printing frame
over a positive film of the same length and width.</p>

<p>The explanation of one printing machine will
suffice to indicate the general principle. Some of
the machines are worked by hand power, but in the
larger reproduction studios electric power is used
practically altogether for running the battery of
printing machines.</p>

<p>The spool of negative film is slipped on to a spindle
so that it can unwind easily, and immediately underneath
it the roll of unexposed positive film, properly
perforated along the edges in exactly the same
way that the negative film is perforated, is suspended
on a similar spindle. Of course the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
light in the printing room is the photographer's
ruby lamp.</p>

<p>The two films unwind and pass downward, with
the sensitive surfaces to the inside, and the positive
on the outside of the negative. They are drawn
together, and with the positive stretched flatly over
the negative they pass over a pair of smooth rollers
and toothed sprockets which enter the perforations
of the two films with mathematical accuracy. They
then make a small loop and enter a side hinged gate
which holds them tightly against the printing aperture.
This aperture is a hole just the size and shape
of each picture on the film, and through it shines
a very bright light which casts its direct rays upon
the negative and imprints the image of the negative
film upon the sensitized surface of the positive film.
After passing the printing aperture, the two films
make another small loop, run down to another
toothed sprocket wheel and roller, and then separate,
the printed positive being rolled upon one spool
and the negative upon its spool below.</p>

<p>The action of this machine is very similar to that
of the motion-picture camera, for like the device for
taking the photographs, the movement must be
intermittent in order to obtain good results.</p>

<p>If the operator desires to see whether the two films
are in exactly the right position and everything is
going smoothly, he can, by the use of a lever in the
printing gate, drop a little red screen between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
light and the films, and by looking through the
hole see through the unprinted positive, and the
developed negative, to the light inside.</p>

<p>After a roll of positive has been printed, it is developed
by just about the same process as is used
in bringing out the images on the negative film.
Then, after it is dried, the various scenes are joined
together, titles and sub-titles put in, any final
editing that is necesary is done, and the positive film
is ready to be put on the projection machine for
the first trial.</p>

<p>The preparation of the titles, sub-titles, and other
explanatory writings that are thrown on the screen
in the course of a cinematograph play is a comparatively
simple matter. The words are written or
printed out in large letters on cards and photographed
by a camera with a slower movement than the ones
used for recording moving figures. The positives
are made from the negatives so taken, in the same
way that positives of other films are made, and after
development and drying are ready to be joined to
the film in the proper places.</p>

<p>Every firm engaged in the fascinating business of
making and reproducing cinematographic plays gives
the most careful and painstaking attention to the
first "performance" of a film. Of course it is held
in private before only the officials and a few critics
invited for the exercise of their judgment. The
event amounts to the same thing as the dress rehearsal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
of a play to be reproduced upon the stage,
and any changes that are necessary in the judgment
of the critics cause just about as much trouble.
Any one of a hundred things may be wrong. Some
little incongruous detail in the scenery may be
noticed, some jarring gesture by an actor or a scene
in which the action does not proceed fast enough.</p>

<p>If the officials of the firm decide that a film is
below their standard, parts must be cut out, and new
parts photographed over again until the whole
thing suits requirements. Sometimes one scene
must be done over many times before it suits exactly,
and several hundred feet of film wasted. At
a cost of about three cents a foot, it is plain that the
waste in film alone is great, but when a big scene
with a hundred or so actors in it has to be done over
again, the cost of assembling the company, paying
their salaries and other expenses is enormous.</p>

<p>Finally, when the officials themselves are satisfied
with a film it is thrown on the screen for the board
of censors in the various cities, and if it measures up
to standard, and contains no objectionable features,
it is ready for public reproduction.</p>

<p>When all this is done, the printing machine again
comes into play, and as many prints of the negative
as are needed are struck off, for in cinematography,
as in still photography, it is a simple matter to run
off as many prints as are desired, once a good negative
is made. These prints then are sent out to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
as many theatres, in as many different cities, as
desire them, and released for public view on the same
day in every theatre in the country.</p>

<p>Having looked at the motion-picture camera, and
at the complicated process for developing and printing
the films, we are now ready to climb into the
little fireproof box from which comes the beam of
light that throws the pictures on the screen. This is
the projector and it is probably the most complicated
of all the machines used in cinematography. As
it was a development through the application
of well-known mechanical principles we will not
go into this subject more deeply than merely to
understand its central principle, which is intermittent
motion.</p>

<p>The result toward which the inventors worked
was a magic lantern such as was familiar to every
boy ten years ago, that would throw upon the screen
the tiny consecutive pictures on the film, with such
speed, and at the same time so clearly and steadily,
that the effect would be that of figures in motion.
Most boys will remember the flickering, flashing and
jumping that used to be noticeable in motion pictures,
and many are probably aware that it was the
improvement of the projecting machine that did away
with these objectionable features.</p>

<p>The essential parts of the projecting machine are
the lantern with its light and lens, and the device for
running the positive film before the light with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
proper intermittent motion. It might be said generally
that the projecting machine looks like a magic
lantern, but on close examination it will be seen to be
an extremely complicated affair.</p>

<p>The powerful electric light, usually an arc light,
which is placed in a metal box a few inches behind the
rest of the projector, directs its rays through the
glass condensers, thence through the film, and thence
through the lens, which throws the image upon the
white screen or curtain. The condensers are made
of two carefully ground glass parts. The first is
dish shaped, with the concave side turned in toward
the light and the convex side turned outward.
Immediately against it is another condenser the
same diameter and convex on both sides so that the
collected rays from the dished part are shot forward
to a point where they will all converge. This point
is the centre of the lens. From the lens the rays of
light are projected in a widening beam to the white
screen on which the pictures appear.</p>

<p>The film is passed before the beam of light at a
point between the condensers and the lens, so that
the image is projected through the lens. The film
is run before the light with the figures upside down,
like in the ordinary stereopticon, and the lens turns
the image right side up again.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of the solution of the
problem is the advantage taken of the persistence
of vision. Photographed at the rapid rate of sixteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
a second, and thrown upon the screen at the same
rate of sixteen a second, it is plain that the stage of
motion shown in the pictures every sixteenth of a
second is reproduced. With the inability of the
eye to tell that the screen is merely exhibiting separate
photographs, the appearance is of motion. In most
persons this visual persistence is only about one
twenty-fourth of a second, but that is long enough
to allow animated photography to be a pleasing
illusion to them, for it gives the shutter of the
projector time to hide one picture while the mechanism
moves the film down to the next picture, bring
the film to a dead stop, and let the shutter open
again to reveal the next stage of animation.</p>

<p>The manner in which modern mechanical skill
took advantage of this physiological defect, proved
many years ago by the leading scientists, is nearly as
interesting as this slight defect in nature's own
camera&mdash;the eye.</p>

<p>Above the film gate is a metal fireproof box (many
of them are lined with asbestos) in which is the roll
of unprojected positive film. Below it is another
similar box in which the film that has been shown is
wound. The motion, which is directed either by a
crank turned by hand or by electrical power, is
the same speed, and practically the same in detail,
as that of the film in the cinematograph camera.
From the film box the film runs to a roller, where a
sprocket enters the all-important perforations and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
draws out the strip to make a small loop above the
film gate.</p>

<p>The shutter is placed in front of the lens. It is
made up of a black metal circular disk, with either
two or three open spaces, and a similar number of
solid or opaque spaces. In general it looks like a
very wide flat aeroplane propeller. Like the movement
of the camera, the film is stationary while the
shutter is open, and when the shutter is closed the
film is jerked down three fourths of an inch, or the
length of one picture, and brought to a dead stop
by the time the shutter revolves and is open again.
This is repeated sixteen times every second, so the
film is cast upon the screen for one thirty-second part
of a second, and the screen is blank one thirty-second
part of a second while the shutter is closed and, as
we might say, the scenes are being changed for the
next act. Although the movement is just the same
as in the camera, it may be well for the sake of making
the thing perfectly clear to go through the motion
very slowly.</p>

<p>For the sake of keeping out of fractions entirely
too small for our consideration we have assumed that
in both camera and projecting machine the shutter
is open one thirty-second part of a second and then
closed one thirty-second part of a second, the whole
operation taking one sixteenth of a second. As a
matter of fact the effort of the experts in animated
photography is to have the shutter of the camera
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
open for just as brief a space of time as possible,
and on the other hand it is their effort to have the
shutter of the projecting machine open just as long
a space of time as possible, and closed as short a
time as possible. In other words, they desire to
shorten the time when there is nothing on the screen,
and lengthen the time for the eye to photograph
each image on the brain. By using a little different
mechanism in the film gate of the projector this is
accomplished to some extent, as well as obtaining a
clearer, steadier picture than formerly was shown.</p>

<p>You will remember that in the camera and printing
machine the film was jerked down by little teeth or
fingers.</p>

<p>The simpler of the two methods in general use on
projectors now is called the "dog" movement. It is
composed of an eccentric wheel placed below the film
gate, with a little roller projecting from it. The wheel
revolves and once every sixteenth part of a second the
roller is brought around so that it strikes the film
and jerks it down the three fourths of an inch that
makes the space of one picture.</p>

<p>This picture was taken in zero weather on a real stream with real ice menacing the actors in the boats.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The other method is known as the "Maltese Cross"
movement. The name is taken from the fact that
the chief sprocket wheel is shaped somewhat like
a Maltese Cross. This wheel, with four notches in
it, is attached to the sprocket below the film gate,
and it is driven intermittently by a wheel with a
pin that enters one of the notches on the Maltese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Cross wheel at each revolution, and pushes it around
the space of one quarter of a turn. This of course
turns the lower toothed sprocket and jerks the film
down the space of one picture. On the next revolution
of the driving wheel the pin enters the next
notch, turns the Maltese Cross wheel another
quarter of a turn, and, by the motion imparted to the
sprocket, jerks the film down another three quarters
of an inch, thereby pulling another picture into
place as the shutter opens.</p>

<p>Recent improvements on this movement have largely
done away with the jar resulting from the pin catching
the notches in the cross. The wheel that looks like
a Maltese Cross has, instead of four notches, three
grooves, dividing the wheel into three equal parts just
as if a pie were cut into three equal parts but the knife
stopped short, leaving a solid hub in the centre.
The space between each groove represents the length
of one picture on the film. Without going into a
long, tiresome, technical explanation of this very
important little feature of the projecting machine,
it will suffice to say that the three-groove wheel is
connected with the sprocket underneath the film
gate. Near it is a revolving arm, and upon this
arm is a horizontal bar. When the arm makes a
revolution, and reaches a point where it touches
the three-divided wheel, the mechanical adjustment
is so fine that the horizontal bar enters the groove,
and the revolution of the arm carries the three-divided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
wheel around one third of a revolution&mdash;or
the space from one groove to another&mdash;turns the
sprocket and pulls the film down the space of one
picture, with a quick steady pull. After getting
this far, the arm on its upward course leaves the
three-divided wheel, which stands still while the
shutter is open until the arm gets around again, and
as the shutter closes pulls the sprocket around another
space.</p>

<p>The strong light concentrated upon the film, in
just the same way that you concentrate the sun's
rays upon your hand with a burning glass, is very
apt to set the film afire, particularly if through any
slip in the machinery it stops in its rapid progress
of about a foot a second. As machinery is not
infallible, the manufacturers have invented various
safety devices for protecting the film in case the
machinery stops. Of course this is not necessary
when non-inflammable film is used.</p>

ADVENTURES WITH MOTION PICTURES</h2>
</div>

<p class="hanging">PERILOUS AND EXCITING TIMES IN OBTAINING MOTION
PICTURES.&mdash;HOW THE MACHINE CAME TO BE INVENTED,
AND THE NEWEST DEVELOPMENTS IN CINEMATOGRAPHY</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">W</span>ITH a clear understanding of the mechanism
of the various motion-picture machines in
mind, we are free to go on with the scientist
and our young friend to the exciting times experienced
by actors and photographers in making the
pictures that delight people all over the world. First,
however, let us briefly look back over the history
of the art, for there is nothing more interesting than
to follow up the experiments upon which Thomas A.
Edison based his invention of the original cinematograph
or kinetoscope.</p>

<p>Long ago, even before Edison was born, scientists
tinkered with devices that would picture apparent
motion, but they were rude attempts and little
progress was made for many years. The first man
to take a decisive step toward practical cinematography
was Edward (or Eadweard) Muybridge, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
photographer who lived in Oakland, Cal.; so he is
rightly called the father of motion pictures.</p>

<p>Muybridge had been experimenting with snapshot
cameras, as in those days instantaneous photography
with wet plates was comparatively new, and,
being something of an artist as well as a photographer,
he decided that snapshot photographs of animals
and men while running, jumping, and walking would
greatly aid artists in transferring to their canvases
the exact positions of the figures they wished to paint.
In 1872 the people of California were considerably
excited over the feat of Governor Leland Stanford's
trotting horse Occident, which was the first racer
west of the Rocky Mountains to make a mile in
two minutes and twenty seconds, and the Governor
was having him photographed on every occasion.</p>

<p>Governor Stanford also wagered that at one time
during the trotter's stride all four feet were off the
ground. Muybridge suggested his plan for photographing
the animal's every movement, while running,
trotting or walking, as a means of settling the
bet, and the Governor, very much pleased, gave him
free access to the stables and race course.</p>

<p>The photographer built a studio at the course and
systematically went to work. First, he built a high
fence along the track and had it painted white. Then
he securely mounted twenty-four cameras side by
side along the opposite side of the course and stretched
thin silk threads from the shutter of each camera
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
across the track about the height of the horse's knees.
Occident was then led out and ridden along the
course so that he would pass between the white
background and twenty-four cameras. As he came
to each silk thread his legs broke it and opened the
shutter of the camera to which it was attached. Thus
the animal photographed himself twenty-four times
as he passed over the track and showed that Governor
Stanford's contention regarding his movements was
correct.</p>

<p>Laid in consecutive order in which the photographs
were taken, each picture showed a different
stage of the horse's movements, and if the series of
photographs was held together and riffled over the
thumb, so that each one would be visible for just
the fraction of a second, the impression received,
thanks to the persistence of vision, was that of a
horse in motion. When Muybridge went to Paris
the year after taking the photographs of Governor
Stanford's horse he received a warm welcome
from some of the greatest French painters of the
day. He gave several exhibits of his photographs,
but carried the work no farther.</p>

<p>Almost one hundred years before this, several
brilliant Frenchmen were groping in the darkness
for some way of showing motion by means of pictures,
and brought forth a device known as the "Wheel of
Life," or the Zoetrope. It was simply an enclosed
cylinder, and upon the inner lower face, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
free to rotate, were placed a series of pictures showing
the stages of some simple animation, in sequence,
such as two children seesawing, or a child swinging.
The upper surface was pierced with long, narrow
slits, and when one looked through the slits, and the
lower surface with the pictures on it was rotated, one
actually saw only one picture at a time, but as they
passed before the eyes the appearance was of motion.
Various improvements on this idea were made, and
silhouette paintings even were thrown on a screen
so as to give an illusion of motion.</p>

<p>The development of photography was necessary,
however, before motion pictures ever could be a
success. About the time Muybridge took his pictures
the old wet plate was superseded by the dry
plate we know to-day, and scientists began the search
for some material from which they could make film
base.</p>

<p>Before the invention of films, motion pictures, as
they were known at that time, were used chiefly by
scientists in trying to analyze motion which cannot
be traced by the human eye. Among the leaders
in this work was the French scientist Dr. E. J.
Marey, who studied the flight of birds and the
movements of animals and men so carefully that he
wrote a book entitled "Movement," which is still
used by authorities in scientific research.</p>

<p>Doctor Marey set up another camera at the
Physiological Station in Paris with which he and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
associates made pictures of great scientific value.
Those were the days of the early experiment with
flying machines, as will be remembered from Chapter
II, and the French inventors made careful studies
of Marey's pictures of bird flight.</p>

<p>Doctor Marey's stationary camera was a simple
bellows type which took an exceptionally wide plate.
The shutter, which was operated by a crank, was
a disk with slits in it, so that as it turned it intermittently
admitted and shut off the light. Thus,
as a white-clothed figure passed a dead-black background,
in front of the camera, the various stages
of its movements in the course of its trip from one
side of the camera's focus to the other were faithfully
recorded on the plate, each slit making an exposure
of the image on a different section of the plate, showing
the figure in a different position.</p>

<p>Many machines that were merely developments
of the old zoetrope were brought out both in the
United States and Europe, but the greatest obstacle
to their success was that they were peep-hole machines
of the kind that flourished in penny arcades a few
years ago, rather than devices for throwing pictures
on a screen so that a large number of persons could
see at the same time. In general, these old-fashioned
"moving-picture" machines were simply cabinets
in which were mounted a series of transparencies
made from pictures representing the stages of some
simple animation. An electric light illuminated the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
transparencies and they were rotated so that one
picture at a time was seen. In some of the more
improved "wheels of life," such as were shown in
this country, the transparencies in consecutive order
were mounted on a hub like the spokes of a wheel
and were rotated so that one was seen at a time, very
much like the way Muybridge riffled his horse
pictures over his thumb.</p>

<p>All this time two American inventors had been at
work on the two most perplexing problems in animated
photography at that time, and it was through
their achievements that the first practical motion-picture
machine was given to the world, just as it
was through the achievements of the Wright brothers
that the first practical aeroplane was given to the
world.</p>

<p>These two men were Thomas A. Edison and
George Eastman.</p>

<p>Mr. Edison had been working for several years
on a motion-picture machine, but was handicapped
by the lack of a practical film.</p>

<p>Mr. Eastman, after years of experiment, produced
the film that made cinematography possible, in 1889.</p>

<p>With a strong transparent film, flexible, and compressible,
to take the place of the clumsy glass plate,
Edison was ready to go ahead with his work, started
years before, and in 1893 the crowds at the World's
Fair in Chicago saw the first motion-picture machine.
It was called a Kinetoscope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Simple as it was, thousands and thousands dropped
nickels into a slot and peeped into the hole at the
"moving pictures." Some of the boys who read this
may remember machines like it. The mechanism
was in a cabinet in which the pictures were shown on
a positive film. This was about forty feet long and
was strung backward and forward inside the cabinet
on a series of spools in a continuous chain.
The film passed before the peep-hole and the pictures
were magnified by a lens. They were illuminated
by an electric lamp behind them. A rotating
shutter cut off the light intermittently, so that each
picture was seen for the fraction of a second, and
then a period of darkness ensued. The shutter
was the only attempt at intermittent revealing of
the pictures, for the film travelled continuously.</p>

<p>The camera that Edison invented for taking the
pictures shown in his kinetoscope was in principle
about the same as the one described earlier in this
chapter, except that it has been wonderfully improved
in mechanical accuracy and photographic clearness.
The hardest problem facing him was the machine
which would show the pictures to a large number of
spectators at the same time and do away with the
old peep-hole machine. The idea of the magic
lantern immediately presented itself, but the inventor
quickly saw the necessity of an intermittent motion,
for if the ribbon of pictures was drawn before the
beam of light fast enough to give the illusion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
motion, each picture was thrown on the screen for
such a short time that it was too faint to be seen
easily. From this it was to Edison but a step to
a practicable projector, and nothing remained but
to improve its mechanical working.</p>

<p>Getting motion pictures is the adventurous part
of the business, for this work requires operators and
actors who are athletes and who do not know the
meaning of fear. As pictures of scenery and events
are taken in every corner of the world&mdash;in the
jungles, in the arctic ice, on mountains and in deserts,
the photographers all can tell absorbing stories of
the strange places and things they have filmed.</p>

<p>In the rough the films are divided into four great
general classes, with several special classes besides.
They are scenic, industrial (showing the working of
some great industry like steel making), topical, and
dramatic. Scenic and industrial films are simply
taken at an opportune time, as it is usually not
necessary to make any advance arrangements,
though the photographing may incur great risks.</p>

<p>Topical films, such as the pictures of the recent
Durbar in India or some other great current event,
are very valuable when quickly sent broadcast. Of
course the photographer must have the same news
instinct that the reporter has to get good topical
films, for he must get there first and deliver his
picture "story" to his studio "editors" as quickly
as possible. The photographers often have hair-raising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
adventures in taking such films, as the single
instance of the man who went up Mount Vesuvius
during an eruption and took a cinematograph film
of it will show.</p>

<p>The greatest variety of experiences, however, is to
be found in the making of dramatic films&mdash;that is,
motion-picture plays. As every boy knows, these
stories have just as wide a range as the books in a
library. There are plays based on biblical stories,
and plays dealing with Wild West adventures; there
are farces, comedies, and tragedies; in fact, there
is no limit to the variety. These plays, however,
can be divided roughly into two classes&mdash;that
is, those that are produced on the motion-picture
studio stage and those produced out of doors
with the natural surroundings as the stage. The
interesting things about either kind would fill a
book the size of this.</p>

<p>In the early days of cinematography only simple
shows were attempted, but now nothing is too big
or too complicated or too expensive for the big
concerns making pictures in the United States and
Europe. The first motion-picture studio here was
simply a portable, glass roofed, black walled shed set
on a pivot in Edison's yard in Orange, N. J. It was
called the Black Maria and makes an interesting
contrast to the great glass studio at Bronx Park, N.
Y., costing $100,000, in which many of the Edison
films are now made. All well-equipped motion-picture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
studios these days are fitted out with space
for several stages; a great tank for water scenes,
carpenter shops, scene-painting studios, furniture
and other stage properties to furnish scenes, costumes,
stage fittings, and a great corps of photographers,
mechanics, electricians, etc., besides the
company of well-paid actors who take part in the
shows.</p>

<p>If a play is to be reproduced in the studio, the
architect draws the plans for the scenery, which are
sent to the stage carpenters, who make the framework
and stretch the canvas. The blank scenery is
then sent to the racks, where the scene painters get
to work on it.</p>

<p>In the meantime the property man at the studio,
just like the property man at a theatre, has received
a list of the things he will need to furnish the scene
and give the actors the paraphernalia necessary for
the carrying out of the play. He ransacks his
storeroom and brings out tables, chairs, pictures,
etc. The studio costumer also checks off her list
and sees that she has in her great wardrobe costumes
to dress the characters for their parts.</p>

<p>Meantime the stock company of actors is called
together, the scenario, or plan of the play, is read, and
rehearsals begin. All this part of it and the rehearsing
are very much like the work preliminary to the
staging of a regular play, except that the scenes
are arranged, not according to the size of the stage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
but according to the focus of the camera. Each
scene is timed to the second so that the pantomime
will tell the story but not tire the spectators with
useless repetition. In rehearsing, the actors sometimes
speak their lines&mdash;that is, the words the
character would say&mdash;just as if they were to be
heard, because it often helps them to give the proper
effect.</p>

<p>Finally, when the stage director has one scene of a
play down fine, after perhaps days or weeks of rehearsing,
the photographer is called. He consults with the
stage manager, measures off the distance for his
focus, so that he will get all that is necessary into
the picture, and nothing that is not wanted; and after
seeing that every detail is attended to, the great
battery of arc lights overhead is turned on, and the
stage manager says, "GO!"</p>

<p>The photographer begins to turn his crank, keeping
one eye on the stage and the other on his stop watch,
and the stage director counts off the seconds, meanwhile
shouting instruction to the actors on the stage.
To an outsider the noises sound like a riot or a street
fair rather than a theatrical performance timed to
the fraction of a second in which the movement of
an eye counts in the final effect. While the camera
clicks off sixteen instantaneous snapshots to the
second the stage director calls out the seconds, "One,
two, three. One, two, three. Look out there, don't
get out of focus! Keep toward the centre of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
stage. Now, Jim, run in and grab the book agent&mdash;hurry,
look angry! One, two, three. That's fine!
Hey, there! shake your fist." And so it goes, until
the director rings a bell or shouts, "That's all!" and
the scene is ended. Just as the last pictures are
being run off, a stage hand rushes into the scene and
holds up a large placard with a big number on it.
This number is the number of the scene in the play,
and is watched by the men and women in the assembling
room when they gather the various scenes of a
picture play together and join them up in the proper
order for one continuous roll. Of course in the joining
the number is cut out of the picture for projection.</p>

<p>It very often happens that a stage director in his
effort to get a graphic story reproduced on the film
takes a great many more pictures than can be
crowded within the limits set for the play. Then
with the scenario in front of him, and a good magnifying
glass to bring out the detail of the pictures, he
takes his scissors, just as the editor takes his blue
pencil, and begins cutting from the story the unnecessary
pictures, just as the newspaper or magazine
editor cuts useless paragraphs from the story or
article. He must not cut out any picture that helps
to tell the story, and yet he must sometimes cut out
as much as 400 feet of film. He "kills" an unnecessary
picture here, and an unnecessary picture there,
and adds up their length until the story has been
reduced to the proper size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Although spectacles such as the one in the picture
representing a battle on a bridge, and others
even larger, are staged in the various big motion-picture
studios, the most exciting work in the filming
of motion-picture plays is out of doors where the
natural surroundings make the stage. A great many
of the shows seen to-day are taken this way, with
real trees, real water, real mountains, or real streets
affording the settings. Hence with studios in which
battle scenes, riot scenes, water scenes, and practically
any indoor scene can be reproduced; and also the
great outdoors at the disposal of the cinematographer,
there is practically no limit to the subjects
that can be turned into dramatic films for the education
and amusement of the public.</p>

<p>A few instances of the plays made out of doors will
serve to show the limits to which the producers are
willing to go to get new shows. The Edison company,
with its big studio in New York and its manufacturing
plant at West Orange, N. J., in the heart
of the country where the Revolutionary War was
fought, is reproducing a whole series of films of
American history. These, so far as possible, are
made on the exact spots where the dramatic events
occurred. The first of the series entitled, "The
Minute Men," was taken near Boston, where those
historic defenders of liberty fought for their country.
In this film is the famous scene representing the
Battle of Concord, which was taken on practically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
the identical ground where the battle was fought.
The producers spent a great deal of time in planning
this series of pictures and so far as possible had every
historical fact correct, so that the value of the series
from the educational point of view is apparent. The
other titles in the series will show how the scenes of
the Revolutionary War were brought home to the
American people. They included "The Capture
of Fort Ticonderoga," "The Battle of Bunker Hill,"
"The Declaration of Independence," "The Death of
Nathan Hale," "How Washington Crossed the Delaware,"
"Church and Country; an Episode of the
Winter at Valley Forge," and so on. The film
dealing with Washington's trip across the Delaware
in the ice was made under conditions as nearly like
those of the actual events as possible to get them.
The pictures were taken during the coldest part of
last winter (1912), and the photograph opposite page
<a href="#Page_193">193</a> was taken while the big scene was being acted
out. This was taken in an arm of Pelham Bay, near
New York, and the "scene shifters" had to work
for hours in the bitter cold breaking up the ice and
shifting around the great cakes in order to get the
desired effect. Their success is attested by the
picture reproduced here.</p>

<p>The Selig Company, with studios in Chicago and
Los Angeles, and big stock companies of actors in
both places also take some wonderful outdoor films.
One of these was a play representing life in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
African jungle, for which a special trainload of actors,
and a whole menagerie of elephants, camels, lions,
rhinos, leopards, pumas, zebras, and other animals,
were shipped to Florida, where scenes much like those
in Africa were found. This same company also sent
a stock company and a corps of photographers to
the Far North, where a film play was made amid the
Arctic ice.</p>

<p>The Chicago studio of this concern is one of
the wonders of cinematography, for not only
has it a great building in which indoor plays are
filmed, but a great land reserve for outdoor productions.
In one place are artificial hills built in the
natural forest, and upon them artificial feudal
castles. In another are log cabins for frontier scenes,
and in yet another a barren stretch for other kinds
of scenes. The Los Angeles company is close to
the mountains, the ocean, and the Great American
Desert, so that it can furnish material for an endless
amount of exciting Wild West shows.</p>

<p>One of the big films made in Europe was "The Fall
of Troy," produced by the Itala Film Company,
which reproduced the great wooden horse, the walls
of Troy, and all other historical details. The great
French, German, and English companies also have
made big films.</p>

<p>In the production of plays built on well-known
novels the motion-picture industry has found one
of its most successful fields. Dickens's great novel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
"A Tale of Two Cities," afforded the Vitagraph
Company of America, one of its best films, while
James Fennimore Cooper, Alexander Dumas, and
even Shakespeare, and grand opera have been
transferred to the cinematograph. From the great
Biblical stories also have been taken films that have
been shown by missionaries, and others interested in
religious work, all over the world. The "Passion
Play" was one of the first long films ever shown and
it made a tremendous success.</p>

<p>Big spectacles are always popular and to fulfill
the demand two locomotives have been run together
at high speed, the motion-picture concern buying
the machines outright for the purpose and leasing
the railroad for a day; an automobile has been driven
over the Palisades of the Hudson River, ships have
been towed out into the ocean and blown up and
whole towns of flimsy stage construction have been
built only to be burned, while the motion-picture
photographer recorded the whole thing on a film.
One concern even got permission from the Los Angeles
Fire department during a big fire, and dressing an
actor as a fireman cinematographed him as he
heroically rushed up a ladder amidst the flames and
rescued a screaming woman from an upper window.
The woman was an actress who had risked her life
to go into the burning building and be rescued.</p>

<p>Of course the great motion-picture industry has
not been without its fatal accidents. Several times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
actors playing the parts of men in difficulty in the
water have actually been seized with cramps and
have drowned before the eyes of the spectators.
One time a picture was being taken of a band of
train wreckers who were supposed to tie the switchman
to the track. The train was supposed to stop
just short of the man, but it actually ran over
and killed him. The pictures were used at the
inquest. During the filming of war pictures there
have been explosions of gunpowder that were not
intended, and in the taking of pictures of wild animals
in their native haunts and in menageries, several
photographers have been badly injured.</p>

<p>There is another big and important department
in the filming of motion picture plays in trick photography.
Every one who reads this has seen at the
picture-theatre films of things that he knows perfectly
well never could have happened&mdash;men walking
on the ceiling, fairies the size of a match acting
on a table beside a man, a saw going through a
board, a piece of furniture assembling itself, a man
run over by an automobile, his legs cut off, and then
stuck on again all within a few minutes, marvellous
railroad wrecks, and a thousand other things which
could not happen or which the motion-picture photographer
probably never could catch in his lens. All of
these things are done through trick photography.</p>

<p>Double exposure, double printing, and the stop
motion are the most common methods of obtaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
these marvellous results. Opposite page <a href="#Page_200">200</a> is a
picture obtained during the reproduction by the
Edison Company of Alexander Dumas's novel, "The
Corsican Brothers." This film was obtained completely
by the double exposure. In the story, the
two brothers are twins so much alike that they
cannot be told apart. They act exactly alike,
and one even feels what, the other feels. In making
the film the producers decided that it would be
impossible to get two actors that looked enough
alike to take the parts of the two brothers, so the
same man acted both parts. In the picture referred
to the brothers sitting at table with their mother
are one and the same actor.</p>

<p>The picture was made by blocking off the whole
left half side of the film with black paper and running
it through the camera while the actor played the
part of the brother on the right side of the table.
He was timed to the fraction of a second, and when
the exposed half of the film was blocked off with
paper and the unexposed half run through, he acted
out his part on the left side of the table, to this time
schedule. So exact was his work that when the
brother on one side of the table spilled a drop of
hot coffee on his hand and started in pain, the
brother on the other side, feeling the same pain
as his counterpart, jumped at exactly the same
second.</p>

<p>Another popular trick with the double exposure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
is a scene showing mermaids or divers swimming or
walking at the bottom of the sea. First a large
brilliantly lighted glass tank is set up in the studio,
stocked with fish and sea life, and photographed.
In this kind of a film the images of the real water
are a little under exposed. Next a space the size
of the tank is measured off on the floor with a gray
scene laid flat. On the scene are painted faint lines
to indicate water, and faint outlines of fish, seaweed,
etc. Then the actress dressed for the part of a
mermaid lies flat on the setting and goes through the
graceful motions of swimming while the film upon
which the real water pictures were taken, is run
through the camera, which is placed above her with
the lens pointing directly downward.</p>

<p>Another example of double exposure is seen in most
films where Lilliputians or small fairies enter into the
picture. The parts of both full-grown human beings
and diminutive fairies are played alike by adult
actors, but the difference in their size is obtained
by taking each on the same film at different times.
For instance, suppose a tiny fairy is supposed to
appear to a grown man in the picture play. First
the man goes through his act with the camera
photographing him from a distance of about fifteen
feet. Next the fairy goes through her act, bowing,
etc., to the place where the man stood and is photographed
on the film from a distance of say one
hundred and fifty feet. The two impressions when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
printed give a lifelike effect of a full-grown man and
a tiny sprite.</p>

<p>There are numberless films made by the stop-motion
system, which simply means that the stage
hands rush in and arrange things while the shutter
is closed. All pictures in which you see a man or a
woman falling off a roof or out of a window and subsequently
getting up and running away are made
by this system. The Edison film showing an automobile
going over the Palisades and the driver being
hurled to the rocks below was done with the stop
motion. It is very simple. The cinematographer
photographed the approach of the automobile and
the human driver in the seat approaching the cliff
at terrific speed. He stopped his camera, the automobile
came to a stop, the automobilist got out and a
dummy was placed in his seat. Then by starting the
automobile a little back of where it was slowed down
and stopped, and photographing, it the public could
not tell that it had been stopped, and that the man
in the seat who was hurled to the rocks below with
the machine was a dummy.</p>

<p>A development of this is the picture-a-turn
motion, which simply means that with each turn of
the crank of the camera one exposure is made. By
this trick many of the strangest films seen are made
possible. The magic carpenter shop where saws and
hammers move without human aid is an example.
It is simply done by stage hands who rush on to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
stage between each turn of the camera and advance
the tools to one more stage of progress. The saw is
at the top of the board, and the hammer is suspended
in air (by invisible wires), etc. In the next picture,
the saw is in different position, and the hammer has
descended to the head of a nail. In this way all the
magical effects of inanimate objects taking on life
in the film are accomplished. One of the interesting
details is the appearance of such objects as boards
rising from the floor and placing themselves upon
the bench ready for the saw. To do this the operator,
keeping his shutter closed, advances his film a couple
of feet and takes a picture of the board falling to the
floor from the bench (pulled off by an invisible wire).
As the film is moving backward, the picture when
exhibited in sequence shows the board not falling
but rising from the floor, and placing itself on the
bench in a most mysterious manner.</p>

<p>Moving the film backward will give many strange
results. For instance, in the plays where a little
child is snatched from death under the wheels of
an onrushing train just as the cow-catcher is upon
her, it is no longer necessary to risk human lives before
trains. First, the onrushing train is photographed
with the film moving forward right up to the point
where the child is to be standing when rescued. Then
the train is allowed to run on past the point. It is
then backed up at high speed, and the film run backward.
When the locomotive rushes past the spot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
where the child is to be rescued her heroic rescuer
simply dashes on to the tracks amid the dust of the
receding train and places the child between the
rails. When this section of film, which is taken
backward, is fitted into the rest of the ribbon, and is
run through the projector forward, it looks as if the
rescuer rushed on to the track and grabbed the
child out of the way as the train passed by.</p>

<p>Another popular trick by which fairies or ghosts
are made to appear gradually in motion-picture
scenes is the one by which the lens is narrowed down
or opened up gradually. If a ghost is to appear, the
hole through which the light strikes the lens is
narrowed down so that only the brightest objects
are photographed. The hole is gradually enlarged
so that the light increases and brings out the figures
plainer and plainer, until the ghost is in full view.</p>

<p>A great many good films, such as railroad wrecks,
automobile journeys through the clouds, etc., are
made with models, propelled by invisible strings over
skilfully built scenery. The scene of figures walking
on the ceiling is very simple inasmuch as it is only
necessary to set the floor of the stage to represent
a ceiling and take the pictures with the camera upside
down. Men and animals can be made to run
up the sides of buildings, simply by laying the
scenery on the studio floor, and photographing the
whole thing from above.</p>

<p>Of the recent developments in cinematography the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
ones we hear most about are colour pictures and talking
pictures. So far, these two points which would
give the last touch of realism to the scenes thrown
on the screen are in a very imperfect state of development,
but it is safe to say that it will not be very
many years before we will have them duplicating
what we see and hear in actual life just as faithfully
as the black and white pictures now duplicate motion.</p>

<p>Science so far has not given us a method of actually
taking a motion-picture negative in the natural
colours, such as now can be taken in still photography,
so at first the pictures were coloured by
hand, and later by stencils. This is a difficult and
a tedious undertaking, however, and newer methods
have been introduced.</p>

<p>Although there are several systems being worked
out the one best known is the Kinemacolour, which
achieved its greatest fame by showing the pictures
of the coronation of King George in England, and
the Durbar in India in colours. The Kinemacolour
system is simply one of photographing and projecting
through screens of red and green. The shutter of
the camera is made up of four parts, as follows: a
transparent red screen, an opaque space, a transparent
green screen, and another opaque space.
Thus, by the law of colours laid down by science,
when one picture is photographed through a red
screen, all the different tones but red are arrested
by the screen, and only the objects having shades
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
of red are photographed. Next, when the green
screen exposes the next space of three quarters
of an inch, only the objects having green tints are
photographed, as all other tints are arrested by the
green screen.</p>

<p>The film itself shows no colour other than black
and white, but when it is projected through a shutter
that works exactly the same as the camera shutter
the pictures show the objects in their natural colours.
That is, the alternating pictures taken through the
red screen and shown through a screen of the same
colour show all the tones of red, while the alternating
pictures taken through the green screen and likewise
projected through a green screen show all the
tones in which appear green. Thus, with the aid
of the persistence of vision and a somewhat faster
system of photographing and projecting, the tones
blend and we see on the screen at the same instant
red-coated soldiers marching past beautiful green
trees, and so on. In order to make this possible
it is necessary to give the films a treatment in a
solution that makes them more sensitive to all
light than they would be for ordinary cinematography.</p>

<p>The drawback to the system, as you will have
noticed if you have seen these pictures, is that red
and green do not make up all the <i>primary</i> colours
of light. In the direct rays of light (not reflected
light as from a painted wall) the primary colours,
from which all the other tones are obtained, are red,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
green, and violet, but it has been found a little too
difficult a mechanical process to use the three screens
instead of only two.</p>

<p>The hardest job of the inventors of talking pictures
was to work out a mechanical device that would
make a good phonograph and a motion-picture projector
keep step, so that, for instance, the actor
would not be heard singing after the pictures had
shown him close his mouth and leave the stage. Ever
since his invention of the Kinetoscope, Edison has
had this very thing in mind, and has prophesied that
in the near future grand opera with motion pictures
and phonographs will be within the means of every
patron of the motion-picture theatre. Edison's
idea for obtaining this is to make the phonographic
and the cinematographic records at the same time
in order to insure perfect accuracy of sound and
appearance, and his experiments are meeting with
success.</p>

<p>A fairly successful device for giving the phonograph
and the projector synchronism, or, in other
words, keeping them in step, has been worked out
by the Gaumont firm of Paris. The phonograph
and the projector are run by two motors of exactly
the same size and power, from the same wires. The
armatures of the motors are divided into an equal
number of sections, and each section of one is connected
with the corresponding section in the armature
of the other, so that one cannot rotate for the fraction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
of a second unless the other rotates with it. A
little switch working on another motor, which works
on a set of gears, will speed up or slacken down the
talking machine so that if the armatures get "out
of step" one can be speeded up or slowed down so
that the figures in the pictures will appear to be talking,
laughing, or singing, just as they do in real life.</p>

<p>Another of the recent developments in cinematography
is the di-optic system which aims to show
every stage of the motion of figures, instead of
the stage of motion every sixteenth of a second,
as is in the case with the usual apparatus. The
di-optic camera is simply two machines set side by
side in one. It takes two loads of film, has two film
gates, and two lenses, but works by turning one crank.
The single shutter revolves in front of the twin
lens, so that when one side is exposing a length of
film the other is closed and the film is advancing.
The two rolls of negative exposed in this way record
the complete motions of the figures before the
camera. The projector also is a di-optic machine
working in the same manner as the double-eyed
camera, so that when the pictures are thrown on the
screen they are seen practically constantly, instead
of every sixteenth of a second, for while one is
hidden by the shutter, another is thrown on the
screen. Also inventors are working on a scheme
for taking motion pictures on glass plates instead
of on films.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
As was mentioned previously the use of the motion-picture
machine has been very valuable to science,
and by adapting the cinematograph to a powerful
microscope a great many motion pictures of the life
of bacteria have been obtained. Also motion pictures
are sometimes made of surgical operations.
Carrying this work even farther still, animated
photography and X-ray photography have been
joined so that science now can make motion pictures
of the processes that go on inside small animals.</p>

<p>Owing to difficulties not yet overcome moving
X-ray pictures cannot be taken of the human body
at this time. R√∂ntgen rays cannot be refracted, or
collected in a lens. Hence the film for an X-ray
picture must be equal in size to the picture desired.
It is impossible to increase the size of cinematograph
films with much success because of the danger of breaking
or tearing them when under the strain of the rapid
course they must pursue through camera and projector.
These facts made it necessary for the scientists experimenting
with X-ray motion pictures to photograph
only animals, but they were greatly encouraged because
they obtained some excellent views of the digestive
processes of mice, guinea-pigs, fowls, and other
small animals. The bones of the human hand also
were photographed while the hand was opened and
closed.</p>

<p>M. J. Garvallo, who carried on a great many interesting
experiments in France with this type of motion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
pictures, used a somewhat larger and more sensitive
film than the standard, combined with an apparatus
too complex for attention here. This phase of
cinematography, however, is still in its infancy and
we can look for great improvements at an early
date.</p>

<p>Another Frenchman, Prof. Lucien Bull, who was
one of Doctor Marey's assistants in the early stages
of cinematography, has made pictures of the movement
of the wings of various insects such as flies,
bees, wasps, etc. To do this he has had to make the
fastest known cinematograph. It was an especially
constructed apparatus entirely unlike the ones
described here, but through the agency of an electrical
spark which illuminated the vicinity in which the
insect flew, 2,000 pictures per second were taken,
instead of the usual sixteen.</p>

<p>The very antithesis of the scientific are the uses
of the motion-picture film as an illustrated magazine
or newspaper. There are only a few successful
"animated newspapers" in the world, but the idea
will probably spread. The staff of such a publication
is made up of photographers, who are scattered
about in every nation on the globe. There are
regular offices in all the big cities which are ready at
a moment's notice to send photographers to any part
of their territory. These photographers get films
of all the important news occurrences of the day,
parades, street demonstrations, wrecks, fires and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
whatever else fills the newspapers you read every
day. The films are hurried to the main office where
they are developed, cut down to short "items,"
or allowed to run as long, "stories" just like in a
regular newspaper, pasted together with suitable
headlines, printed in one continuous roll of about
1,000 feet and rushed out to the subscribers, who
are usually theatres with audiences eager for the
"paper."</p>

<p>Such are a few of the many motion-picture activities
which have sprung up in the last few years,
and made it possible for us to see whatever is interesting
in any part of the world, on the cinematograph
screen. Beside the professional cinematographers,
there are of course any number of smart
boys and young men who are having fine times
with the amateur projecting outfits sold by the big
makers of apparatus. These machines run from
mere toys made up for a little roll of film, already
prepared, to projectors with which very creditable
parlour shows can be given.</p>

most of the time is nothing compared to the heat
that we can put to practical use through a couple
of new inventions I have been trying here."</p>

<p>"What are they for?" asked the boy, immediately
all interest, for he was a member of the metalworking
class in his school, and was constantly on

copper, and brass.</p>

<p>"Well, they both are used in welding metals and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
in one&mdash;the thermit process&mdash;the hardest steel
can be reduced to a molten mass of white hot metal
boiling like a tea kettle on a stove, in about a half
a minute. You see that requires a great deal of
heat," continued the chemist, "and in fact the
temperature is 5,400 degrees, Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>"The other process that I have been trying is
known as autogenous welding, and in this even a
greater temperature is generated than by the thermit
process. In the tiny flame no bigger than the point
of this pencil that comes from the autogenous welding
torch the temperature is about 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit."</p>

<p>"My!" said the boy, "how could any one ever
measure such a heat as that?"</p>

<p>"Science teaches us how to do that just as science
taught us how to produce these great heats. Why,
you know, in the electrical furnaces at Niagara Falls
they produce a heat that they think reaches the
10,000 degrees of the sun. Outside of that, however,
the thermit process and the autogenous welding
process attain the greatest known heats."</p>

<p>"Those must be fine," said the boy, "because
before our schools began to teach metal working,
I used to play blacksmith and heat pieces of iron
in the fire, but I could never do anything with it,
and now that we are learning welding in the blacksmith
shop at school I see what a hard job it is. I
wish we could use these processes at school."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
"Well, you will be able to use them some day,"
said the scientist, "but it took science a long time
to find out how to produce and use very high temperatures.</p>

<p>"In the stone age, thousands and thousands of
years ago, when men lived in caves and ate raw the
animals that they caught with their hands, fire was
first discovered by an accident. There are many
legends of how the hairy savages that populated the
earth fell down and worshipped the aboriginal
scientist who taught them how to warm their caves.</p>

<p>"Soon, however, fire became a necessity of life
to mankind, for it was discovered that meat tasted
better when exposed to a flame&mdash;that, is, when it
was cooked&mdash;than when it was raw. That was a
big step toward civilization, but it was a bigger one
when some wild mountain tribe found that they could
make much more deadly weapons than the rude ones
they chipped from flint, by melting down a certain
kind of rock and fashioning it into spear heads,
arrow heads, and hatchets. From that time on
the development of the art of metal working took
only a few thousand years, until to-day man's great
knowledge of metalurgy has enabled him to make
such tremendous fighting machines that war is becoming
entirely too destructive, and too expensive
a thing to rush into lightly. Thus, heat and metal
working are helping to force the world forward to
another step in civilization&mdash;universal peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
"After learning how to make these hardest of
metals, man has now solved the problem of making
them boil like water with the thermit process and of
cutting them like paper with the oxy-acetylene gas
torch, all in less than a minute.</p>

<p>"You see this bag of coarse black powder that
looks like iron filings? Well, it is the thermit. Put
it into a crucible, set off a pinch of ignition powder
on the top, and the whole thing will ignite in half
a minute, throwing off a blinding white light and
thousands of sparks like beautiful fire works. That
is the thermit reaction.</p>

<p>"You know more about the oxy-acetylene gas torch,
for in your metal working at school you used the gas
blowpipe to make a very hot flame. The oxy-acetylene
gas torch is just a high development of
this, for instead of ordinary gas, acetylene is used
and instead of air we use pure oxygen."</p>

<p>The caller sat down and asked his friend to tell
something more about these two marvelous inventions.
The story was several days in the telling,
for there were visits to foundries and experiments
in the laboratory, besides many long talks.</p>

<p>Imagine sticking your finger into boiling water.
By so doing you would be exposing your flesh to a
temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit. Imagine
sticking your finger into a pot of molten lead if even
for the fraction of a second. You know very well
what the effect would be. The temperature is 618

3,000 degrees Centigrade, which is attained by the
thermit reaction. The range of temperature in
which we can live extends from a little over 100
degrees to 70 or 80 degrees below zero, and yet man
can so direct the heat of the thermit reaction that
it will work for him.</p>

<p>The commonest use of the process is in welding
steel or iron, such as broken parts of machinery and
welding steel rails, and steel or iron pipes. Besides
this, the thermit process will reduce many metals
to a high degree of purity. After spending a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
minutes in seeing how the inventor of this process
came to discover it, we will take a little trip in our
mind's eye to some of the places where the thermit
process is in use, and see what happens.</p>

<p>As you know, metals rarely come from the mines
in a state of purity. They usually are very much
mixed up with rock, slag, and other minerals, so that
it takes a complicated process called smelting to
separate them. Even then they are not pure, and
more complicated processes have to be gone through
with. Oxides, or metals that have been oxidized,
are common because oxidization merely means that
the metal has been burned so that each atom of
metal has taken up an atom of oxygen to make what
is called a molecule of oxide. Iron ore is usually
found in the form of iron oxide, because when this
great earth was nothing but a swirling ball of burning
gases, probably as hot as the sun, gradually cooling
and forming a great cauldron of molten matter,
boiling and bubbling more fiercely than the hottest
cauldron of molten metal in any steel mill, much of
the matter that later became iron ore was burned or
oxidized. Other chemical actions too technical for
our attention just now were responsible for other
forms of ore, such as sulphides, etc. When the
earth cooled sufficiently to become solid, these things
were completed, and they only had to remain hidden
away under the surface for ages and ages until
a little man who could live but a hundred years at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
the utmost solved the deepest secrets of the earth's
formation.</p>

<p>Thus, to obtain pure metals the oxygen must be
removed from the oxide. In other words, it must
be reduced. Plainly such reduction was a problem
of smelting, but Doctor Goldschmidt in his efforts
to obtain purity was working along lines of smelting,
in his little German laboratory, very different from
the ones in general use.</p>

<p>His first object was to reduce iron oxides. First,
he knew that aluminum has a great affinity for
oxygen, or, in other words, when the two are heated
will absorb oxygen like a sponge will absorb water,
only more forcibly and more violently than any such
comparison even faintly suggests. In yet other
words, aluminum wants oxygen more than any other
metal does. Of course no chemical changes would
occur if a piece of iron oxide and a piece of aluminum
were set side by side, any more than we would have
gunpowder if we set a chunk of saltpetre, a chunk
of sulphur, and a chunk of charcoal all in a row.
The iron oxide and the aluminum would have to be
mixed by cutting or filing them into small pieces and
making a coarse powder. Still nothing would happen
without heat to start it.</p>

<p>If you collected some flakes of iron oxide in the
palm of your hand they wouldn't look to you like very
promising material for a bonfire, and you wouldn't be
in any danger of an explosion, but you would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
something in your hand that would burn, nevertheless.
If you sprinkled your iron filings over a gas
flame, Welsbach burner, or over a common lamp
chimney the heat would cause them to splutter and
fly out with all the brilliancy you know so well
when the blacksmith gives the redhot horseshoe the
first pound.</p>

<p>Of course Doctor Goldschmidt knew all this, just
as he knew that the way the aluminum would take
the oxygen away from the iron oxide was through
heating the coarse powder of filings to a very high
temperature. But this was attended with serious
troubles and many times the German scientist came
near losing his life in explosions in his laboratory.</p>

<p>At first he failed to get the mixture hot enough and
nothing happened. Bit by bit he increased the heat
under the crucible containing the filings until it
reached about 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. At this
point the metals were hot enough to fuse or run
together and the whole thing reacted with such
violence that it amounted to an explosion. What
really happened was that the mass reached the temperature
where the aluminum could take the oxygen
from the iron oxide, and it did so with such force
that an explosion resulted.</p>

<p>Doctor Goldschmidt then saw his problem. It
was that of devising some way of heating the mixture
to a temperature sufficient to gain the reaction,
but without an explosion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
After trying everything that he could think of, he
conceived the plan of leaving the crucible in the
open air and starting the heat at just one point
first, instead of heating the whole thing in a furnace.
He did this with a pinch of ignition powder placed
on the top of his pile of iron oxide and aluminum.
The ignition powder was simply lighted with a
match.</p>

<p>What happened?</p>

<p>Thermit was discovered.</p>

<p>The heat, or reaction started at one point, gradually
spread through the whole mass, and reduced
it to white-hot molten material.</p>

<p>In other words the application of intense heat at
one point in the mixture was sufficient to fuse the
metals and start the battle between the iron oxide
on one side and the aluminum on the other, in the
immediate vicinity of the point where the heat was
applied. As the few particles set off by the ignition
powder struggled for the oxygen they themselves
generated heat&mdash;terriffic heat&mdash;which gave a high
enough temperature to start the particles that were
their next-door neighbours to struggling for the
oxygen. These in turn generated heat to set off their
own neighbours, and so it went.</p>

<p>In far less time than it takes to read this, Doctor
Goldschmidt saw the whole crucible of dead mineral
particles take on life and become white-hot liquid metal.
Scientifically speaking, the reaction had spread through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
the whole mass in less than a minute, but what Doctor
Goldschmidt saw was a blinding white light, more intense
than any arc lamp, throwing off a little cloud of
white smoke or vapour. Apparently the whole thing
was burning up. He only heard a little hissing as
the metals battled for the precious oxygen.</p>

<p>There was no explosion, there was no violent
scattering of molten particles, and there were no
noxious life-destroying gases such as come from the
explosion of gunpowder, dynamite, or even the
burning of coal. And yet the seething, molten
metals in the crucible reached a temperature second
or third to the highest ever registered by man. Five
thousand four hundred degrees&mdash;think of it!&mdash;more
than half as hot as science tells us is the sun which
makes this world of ours habitable.</p>

<p>But what was the result of this temperature which
staggers the imagination?</p>

<p>Just this. Doctor Goldschmidt knew that the
aluminum had won the prize of battle and had paid
the price of victory.</p>

<p>The conquered iron was at the bottom of the
crucible, a molten mass of pure metal, while the
victorious aluminum, seething on the top, was nothing
but slag (aluminum oxide).</p>

<p>Perhaps there may be a little lesson in this drama
of the metals, because while the iron was vanquished
it emerged from the stress of conflict purified and
fitted for its high service to mankind, while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
more aggressive aluminum came to the top an almost
useless product, ruined by the prize for which it had
fought.</p>

<p>Another interesting point about this reaction is
that the heat produced by a certain quantity of the
mixture is no greater in total volume than the heat
that would be produced by the burning of an equal
amount of anthracite coal. The difference is that
the thermit process concentrates all the heat in a
few seconds whereas the coal gives off its heat bit
by bit for a long period of time.</p>

<p>The mixture of filings used in this process is called
thermit. A technical definition of the product is as
follows: "Thermit is a mixture of finely divided
aluminum and iron oxide. When ignited in one
spot, the combustion so started continues throughout
the entire mass without supply of heat or power from
outside and produces superheated liquid steel and
superheated liquid slag (aluminum oxide)."</p>

<p>Thus the makers of thermit call the pure metal
that results from the combustion, thermit steel.</p>

<p>For the boy who has studied chemistry the simple
equation by which the scientist described the process
to his young friend will mean as much as his long
explanation. The equation is:</p>

<p>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2Al = Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2Fe.</p>

<p>The scientist simply went on to say that Fe<sub>2</sub>, iron,
and O<sub>3</sub>, oxygen, in the equation means iron oxide,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
while 2Al means aluminum. Thus we have iron oxide
plus aluminum, heated to 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit,
equals aluminum oxide, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, plus pure iron, 2Fe.
These signs are simply the abbreviations scientists
use for expressing processes in the terms of mathematical
equations.</p>

<p>With this general outline of the principle of
the thermit process in mind its actual application
will seem a simple matter. Suppose that a great
steel ship ploughing her way through a storm breaks
her sternframe. This is the steel framework upon
which the rudder post is mounted, and naturally
a fracture puts the rudder out of commission.
Repairs must be made before the ship can make another
trip. Quick repairs are desired by the owners.
Perhaps the ship is a passenger steamer due to leave
port in a few days with passengers and mail, so to
put the liner in drydock, wait for the steel mills to
cast a new sternframe, wait for it to come by freight,
and then wait for the steelworkers to fit the piece
in the place of the broken one is a matter of weeks,
perhaps more.</p>

<p>With the thermit process at hand this is not necessary.
The company that manufactures and sells
thermit has big plants in several cities in various
parts of the world, but if there is steel repairing to
be done elsewhere the company will send its materials
and expert workmen on a minute's notice. So if
the crippled ship limps into the port where there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
is a thermit plant the repairs can begin at once, but
there need be only a little delay otherwise, because
the captain of the ship can notify his owners of
the damage by wireless while still out at sea, and long
before he reaches the port he is making for they
can have a complete thermit outfit on the way.</p>

<p>One of the biggest advantages of the thermit
process of repairing machinery or structural steel
is that the welding in a great many cases can be
made without taking the complicated parts to
pieces. Consequently after the ship is in drydock
the workmen build a wooden scaffolding about the
broken sternframe, so that they can work the better.</p>

<p>The next step is the preparation of the broken
parts for welding. Most boys know how the doctor
has to put splints on a broken arm so that it will
knit properly. It is something like that with a
thermit weld.</p>

<p>The broken parts are supported in exact alignment
by heavy blocks of concrete, and the fractured ends
sliced off clean by the oxygen-gas torch. This
leaves a space of from one inch to two and a half
inches between the fractured ends, just according
to the size of the piece to be welded. After the
parts are all thoroughly cleaned the workmen are
ready to take the next step.</p>

<p>This is the preparation of the mould for the weld.
First, a pattern of the weld, as it will appear when
completed, is put on the fracture with beeswax. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
space between the broken ends is filled in and a thick
"collar" of wax is packed around the parts, so that
when this is done the pattern looks like a swelling
on the frame. The mould is then built around this
wax pattern.</p>

<p>The inventor of the thermit process had to make
a number of experiments before he found a material
refractory enough to stand the terrific heat to which
the mould had to be exposed. Finally he decided
upon an equal mixture of fire brick, fire clay, and fire
sand.</p>

<p>With this material, then, the workmen go about
making the mould. It is solid, with the exception
of three apertures or tunnels, which are left by
inserting in the moulding clay, wooden models of
the size and shape desired. These are a gate, or
place into which the molten welding material is to be
poured, a "riser" or larger hole into which the
surplus material can run for the overflow, and a
heating aperture. The gate runs from the top of
the mould down to the lowest point of the wax
pattern, while the "riser" extends from the top of
the wax pattern to the top of the mould. Thus we
really have a small inlet and large outlet, although
it is always arranged so that the surplus metal
remains in the riser, and as little as possible runs
over. The heating aperture is a small hole in the
side of the mould extending to the bottom of the
wax pattern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
With the mould complete the wooden models of
the gate, riser, and heating aperture are pulled out
and the first step in the process of welding is taken.
The long pipe of a specially constructed gasoline
compressed-air torch is inserted in the heating
aperture and the process called preheating started.
The gasoline torch, of course, quickly melts the
beeswax, and leaves the space occupied by the
pattern clear for the molten metal that is to be
introduced to make the weld. The blast from the
torch is continued through this heating aperture
until the parts to be welded have reached a red heat,
because if this were not done the cold steel would so
chill the molten thermit steel that the weld could
not be accomplished. The length of time taken by
this preheating is governed, of course, by the size
of the parts to be welded. Sometimes it is many
hours.</p>

<p>Everything is now ready for the thermit. There
has been some elaborate preparation of the thermit
too. The coarse powder or grains of iron oxide and
aluminum previously have been prepared according
to the job to be done. In very large welds, or
welds where very hard steel is required, certain
additions, to be explained later, are made to the
thermit.</p>

<p>The amount of thermit to be used is an important
factor, of course, as there must be plenty to fill the
mould, and yet not so much that it will overflow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
the riser. To decide on the amount takes a careful
calculation because in large operations there are
certain additions to the thermit which have to be
considered. In general, however, the engineer must
remember that he must have just twice as much
molten thermit steel as he needs to fill the space left
by the melting of the wax pattern. The surplus
flows up into the riser, heating aperture, and gate,
effectually closing all of them. The calculation,
then, is that it takes four and a half ounces of steel
to fill a cubic inch. It takes nine ounces of thermit
to produce four and a half ounces of steel, so the
engineer directing the weld must figure on eighteen
ounces of thermit to each cubic inch in the wax
pattern, including the space between the parts to
be welded.</p>

<p>After seeing that the proper amount of thermit
is measured out the engineer must see that the
crucible in which the reaction is to take place is
ready to contain the strenuous battle that is to be
fought in it.</p>

<p>As before mentioned there are very few products
that can withstand the heat of the fire produced by
thermit. Ordinary fire brick and mortar would melt
or be burned to powder in a few seconds. Metal would
go the same way that the metal in the crucible goes.
Science, however, has established that magnesia tar is
not affected by the thermit fire, so the crucible in which
the thermit is reduced is heavily lined with magnesia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
tar. The crucible itself is shaped like a cone with
the point downward. At the bottom is a magnesia
stone, which has a conical-shaped hole for the
"thimble." This "thimble" also is made of magnesia
stone, and has a hole through it for the molten
thermit steel to run through after the reaction has
taken place. Before filling the crucible with the
thermit, however, the pouring hole is very carefully
plugged up by a special process, with a little steel
pin protected by fire sand and fire clay. This pin
extends below the lowest point of the crucible a
couple of inches, and by knocking it upward the
molten metal is allowed to flow out. The upper
end of this little plug that otherwise would be melted
instantaneously by contact with the burning thermit,
as indicated above, has to be protected by a layer of
fire sand. The hole through which the metal flows
is never more than half an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>With the crucible, mould, and thermit prepared,
the next thing is to put the thermit in the crucible
and put the crucible in place. There are many ways
of placing the crucible. In some cases, it is hung by
a chain and in others it is supported by a tripod or
wooden scaffolding. The latter is the better because,
though the wood always catches fire from the heat,
it can be kept standing by throwing on water,
whereas steel or iron would be eaten in two in an
instant by the touch of a few sparks of flying thermit.
The point is to support the crucible so that the pouring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
hole is directly over the entering gate, or pouring
gate of the mould.</p>

<p>Things move with a rush now, for all these arrangements
are made ahead of time, and as soon as the
workmen are sure that the parts in the mould are
redhot the heating aperture is carefully plugged
with fire sand and the thermit is ignited. From a
mere pinch to half a teaspoonful of the ignition
powder is put into a little hollow in the thermit so
that the heat may be communicated at once to as
much of the thermit as possible. This is then set
off with a storm match. The workman quickly
withdraws his hand, slams the lid on to the crucible
and gets out of the way of flying sparks.</p>

<p>There is a hiss, a puff of white smoke, a blinding
glare from the hole in the top of the crucible, and
that is all, beside a few sparks, to indicate that a
heat second only to that of the sun is being
generated within.</p>

<p>One cannot help but marvel at the wonders of science
as this inconceivable heat is being produced, the
process is seemingly so simple, so easily handled,
and so accessible for all kinds of work where steel
welding is necessary.</p>

<p>Half a minute to a minute (according to the
amount of thermit used) after the match has been
applied a workman holding at arm's length a long
tool called a "tapping spade" gives a few upward
knocks to the little metal pin extending down from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
the closed pouring aperture. He jumps back for the
heat is enough to set his clothes afire, even at a
considerable distance, and a few flying particles
of the molten thermit would inflict a serious burn.</p>

<p>Down through the little hole the thermit, that a
minute before had been only a coarse dark gray
powder like metal filings, seemingly the last thing
on earth that would catch fire, flows into the
pouring gate of the mould in a steady stream of
white-hot liquid steel. The white glow from the
metal is brighter than any electric light. It is so
intense that although the workmen wear heavy
dark goggles, they shade their eyes and turn their
heads away.</p>

<p>Now you will be wondering, if you know anything
about steel and its wonderful properties, how it is
that this can be good steel when it is all mixed up
with the aluminum oxide or slag. The reason it
is of best quality is that as soon as the reaction reduces
the whole mass to a molten liquid the heavier steel, set
free, as the scientists say, but as we have chosen to
think of it, robbed of the aluminum, sinks to the bottom,
while the lighter aluminum oxide rises to the top.
Consequently the steel goes into the mould to make
the weld while the slag, having risen to the top, will be
found at the top of the pouring gate, and only around
the outer edges of the weld.</p>

<p>When the pour is completed the workmen go away
and leave it to cool. It is usually left over night,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
sometimes as long as forty hours, when the weld is
a very large one.</p>

<p>Finally the mould is broken down and the weld
is found complete, with big extensions of the steel
extending from the weld, in just the shape of the
pouring gate "riser" and heating aperture.</p>

<p>The molten thermit steel rushing in at the bottom
of the mould has risen between the heated broken
ends, and all around them, in just the shape left by
the wax pattern. As the scientists say, the thermit
steel has united the broken sternframe and formed
a homogeneous mass with it. In other words the
terrific heat of the thermit rushing on the heated
ends has resulted in the two parts becoming one with
the added thermit steel.</p>

<p>After the mould is broken down the oxygen-gas
torch comes into use again to cut away the ends
of steel sticking up where they had cooled in the
pouring gate, "riser" and heating aperture. After
this the weld looks like a great swelling upon the
sternframe, and if the swelling is where it will not
interfere with the working of the rudder or steamer
propellers, nothing more need be done. On the
other hand, if the swelling is in the way, it can be reduced
to the size of the frame, and squared off with
machines built for the purpose.</p>

<p>Thus the ship is repaired and is ready to be
taken out of drydock for her next trip, as good
as new.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
About the same plan is followed out on all kinds
of welding except pipes and rails. Locomotives can
be repaired without taking the complicated machinery
apart just by working around until the
crucible can be so hung, and the pouring gate so
arranged that the metal can be poured into the
place designed for it. The chief difference lies in
the size of the weld to be made and the consequent
amount of thermit to be used. Welds have been
made where as much as 2,000 pounds of thermit&mdash;enough
to make 1,000 pounds of steel&mdash;have
been run into a mould. In these very big welds a
certain percentage of steel "punchings," or small
pieces of steel, and a little pure manganese are
used to give the additional hardness to the weld.</p>

<p>Without going into details as to the manner in
which the principle of the thermit process is applied
on rails or pipes, it will be enough to say that in
welding rails three different systems are used. The
first is done by building the mould around the ends
of the two rails to be welded together and letting
the thermit steel run in and completely surround
the rails and the space between them. This gives
one continuous rail just as far as the welding is
carried on, and one through which the electric current
of an electric road can pass without any trouble
at all. It is plain, then, why this system is used
so much on third rails of electric roads. The trouble
with it is that the swelling on the top and inside of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the rails must be machined down to present a smooth
running surface to the wheels.</p>

<p>The next system, which is now almost out of date,
is one in which two moulds are used so that the
thermit does not come up over the running surface
of the rails. This relieves the engineers of the
necessity of machining the welded joints.</p>

<p>The third system is a mixture of the joining by
plates and the thermit process. This is called the
"Clark joint," after the name of Chief Engineer
Charles H. Clark of the Cleveland, (Ohio) Electric
Company, who formulated the plan. The rails are
joined with plates and bolted, or riveted together
in the old way, but a thermit weld is made at
the base of the rail, welding the bases of the two
rails together and to the plate.</p>

<p>The method of welding steel pipes is an exact
reversal of the principle of welding together solid
pieces of steel or iron. After the pipes are cut off
clean, the mould, which is made of cast iron, is placed
around them with specially constructed clamps to
force the two ends closer together after the thermit
has been poured in. The thermit is then set off in a
flat-bottomed crucible like a long-handled ladle, and
poured into the mould by hand as if from a ladle. As
the slag rises to the top it goes into the mould first
and coats the pipes. The thermit steel does not
touch the pipes, but merely supplies the heat to
weld them perfectly, so that they are as strong as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
piping itself. Just after the pour has been made,
the clamps are tightened up and the white-hot pipe
ends forced together. They are thus held until cold,
when the mould is broken away. The slag coats
the outside of the pipes and this is chipped away,
leaving a perfect weld.</p>

<p>Another interesting use of thermit is in the great
foundries where cauldrons of metal have to be kept
at a very high temperature. To help keep the mass
in a liquid state thermit can be introduced in it
either by throwing it into the cauldrons in bags, with
a little ignition powder so fixed that it will be touched
off by the heat of the boiling metal, or by putting
it in especially designed cans affixed to the ends of
long rods. By these rods the thermit can be plunged
to the bottom of the cauldron before it "burns."
The reaction of the thermit, with the intense heat
caused by it, helps to keep the mass at the proper
temperature.</p>

<p>Also thermit is used in the same way with a small
amount of titanium oxide, to purify iron and steel.
The metal becomes much more liquid, and a commotion
like boiling is started. This is the result of the
titanium driving out the impure gases and driving
other impurities such as metallic oxides and sulphur
contents to the top. Chemically what happens when
the titanium is introduced by the thermit process is
that the titanium combines with the nitrogen in the
molten iron, giving it a much finer grain, and making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
it a much lighter colour, more like steel, than
previously.</p>

<p>One of the things thermit is not extensively used for
is the repairing of gray iron castings. The first reason
is that gray iron is cheaper than steel, and a new
casting often can be turned out by the mills quickly.</p>

<p>Another and a more interesting reason is that gray
iron melts in a much lower temperature than does
thermit steel and consequently has a lower shrinkage.
Therefore when the molten thermit, with its terrific
heat, cools there is a large shrinkage. Thermit
steel being much stronger than gray iron, its shrinking
sometimes strains and cracks the iron casting.</p>

<p>In spite of this difficulty very successful repairs
have been made on cast-iron and it has been found
that by mixing 2 per cent. of ferro-silicon and 1
per cent. pure manganese with the thermit for welding,
a thermit steel is formed which is very soft and
comes close to the properties of gray iron. By
using this mixture important welds have been made
on cast-iron flywheels, water wheels, and other cast-iron
parts with great success.</p>

<p>While industry is making progress with all these
uses of thermit, science is experimenting all the time
to add to the scope of the process. As was pointed
out before, many other metals can be reduced to a
high degree of purity with this process and in the
laboratories they are always trying new ones and
working out new formulas. Of the pure metals that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
can be reduced by the thermit process there are
chromium, which is 98 to 99 per cent. pure; manganese,
which is 96 per cent. pure; and molybdenum,
which is 98 to 99 per cent. pure. These are used
in the manufacture of very hard steel, such as armour
plate, and "high speed steel." Among the alloys, or
mixtures of metals, there are chromium-manganese,
manganese titanium, ferro-titanium, ferro-vanadium,
and ferro-boron, all of which have uses in industry
and help us to travel faster and more safely by
railroad, electric train, and steamship.</p>

<p>It may have occurred to some bright boy that,
since this heat is so intense and so handy, it might
be a good way to make steam in locomotive boilers,
or cook our meals, but it will be remembered that
the heat is all over within a few minutes. In other
words, where a terrific heat is required for a few
seconds, thermit will fill the bill, but where a continuous
heat for many hours is needed, electricity, gas,
coal, coke, oil, or wood are better. The high cost
of aluminum would probably prevent the thermit
process coming into use in the manufacture of steel
for our armour plate, ship plate, or structural steel,
at least for a good many years.</p>

<p>Earlier in this chapter I said that the slag, or aluminum
oxide, from the thermit process was an almost
useless product. This is not the precise scientific truth,
for the slag becomes a black powder such as is used
in making emery wheels, but the slag from thermit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
is never actually used for this. Another use for the
slag from the thermit process in which chromium is
used has been discovered. Potters use a material
called corundum, which this slag resembles, except
that it is superior to natural corundum in pottery
manufacturing because of its freedom from metallic
impurities. The slag can be mixed with clay and
baked. It is especially useful in chemical apparatus
that must withstand great extremes of temperature,
because its experience has so tempered it that nothing
less than a heat equal to that of the sun would give
it much concern.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing about the slag from
chromium thermit is that small rubies have been
found in it. The scientific explanation is that they
are nothing but crystallized alumina, coloured with
chromium. The jewels usually are too small for any
commercial purpose but serve as a very striking
example of the intensity of the thermit fire. All the
real jewels, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, amethysts,
and so on, were formed by the terrific heat in the
bosom of the earth millions of years ago when it was
cooling down from gases hotter than anything we
can possibly conceive of, to a molten ball, then to
a solid redhot mass and then to a globe sufficiently
cool on the outside to be crusted over. That they
can be made in this little chemical furnace shows
how far science has gone in imitation of the wonders
of nature.</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>AUTOGENOUS WELDING AND CUTTING</h3>
</div>

<p>"Now," said the scientist, after he and his young
friend had finished some experiments, and were
ready to talk about autogenous welding, "imagine
a little white flame no bigger than a pencil point at
the end of a brass pipe about the size, and not
entirely unlike in appearance the old-fashioned taper
holder with which you used to light the gas, and you
have before you in the rough, a picture of one of the
oxy-acetylene torches that will in a few minutes weld
two pieces of almost any metal, or in a few seconds
cut a solid plate of the hardest steel of several inches
thickness almost as fast and easy as a carpenter
could saw a board, and yet without taking the temper
out of the metal."</p>

<p>Picking up what seemed to be a little brass rod
bent at the end, the man turned a valve, applied
a match, and as the gas burned up with a beautiful
little flame of dazzling whiteness, he continued:</p>

<p>"This tiny flame, so easily controlled, is hotter
than any produced by man except that generated
by the electrical furnace, for it reaches a temperature
of about 6,300 degrees Fahrenheit. Previous to the
invention of these wonderful torches the oxy-hydrogen
was the hottest gas flame, but it only reached a
temperature of 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit."</p>

<p>"How do you use it?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Well, for instance, Uncle Sam is enabled to weld
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
and cut steel plate in building his battleships, steelworkers
to carry on their gigantic tasks, and wreckers
to clear away tangled masses of steel beams far
more quickly and easily than with the older methods.</p>

<p>"If you had visited one of the navy yards, a shipyard
or any place where big work in iron and steel
was being carried on as short a time as three years
ago, you would have seen a man sitting for hours
sawing away on the end of a steel beam, for instance,
trying to cut it down to the required length. He
would dull many saws, use a great deal of energy,
and an appalling amount of the most valuable thing
in the world&mdash;time. Again, you would have seen
them welding pieces of iron and steel by the old
blacksmith method, or riveting other pieces that
could not be joined by heating them and pressing
them together.</p>

<p>"To-day you would see fewer of these processes
because autogenous welding and cutting by the
powerful little oxy-acetylene torches is revolutionizing
certain methods of working with metals. Instead
of squatting at the end of the beam and sawing away
like an old-fashioned carpenter, the modern iron
worker takes up his little torch, turns a valve in the
handle and concentrates the flame on the steel beam
that he wishes cut. Almost instantly a shower of
sparks on the under side of the beam shows him
that the flame has burned its way through. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
he slowly moves the flame along the line where he
desires to cut and the trick is done."</p>

<p>Illustrating with his own little laboratory torch,
the scientist continued his explanation, saying that
cutting is only one of the many uses to which this
modern invention in steel working is put. Not quite
so spectacular but every bit as useful is the autogenous
welding by means of these magic wands. Welding
metals has ever been more or less unsatisfactory.
The old process of heating the two ends and then
beating them together is cumbersome and practically
impossible in many cases. Consequently inventors
have sought other welding processes with wider
application and greater facility ever since the first
metal workers of earliest times forged crude chains
and weapons. With this modern device two pieces
of steel or other metal are brought to within a small
fraction of an inch of each other and by the use of
the oxy-acetylene torch and a thin strip or rod of
metal are melted and fused together.</p>

<p>Although the acetylene flame gives off a far greater
proportion of light than heat, it is a very powerful
gas and Le Chetalier, a French inventor, was sure
that he could put it to other uses than furnishing
lights for automobiles, etc. To this end he tried
mixing acetylene gas with oxygen, for there can be
no fire or combustion without oxygen. He very
properly figured that by introducing pure oxygen into
the acetylene, the burning, or combustion, would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
greater, and the heat of the flame greatly intensified.
His experiments were ultimately successful, and it was
then only a short step to the time when three different
oxy-acetylene torches were in use. In France
there were developed low pressure, medium pressure,
and high pressure torches; but the last named has
not been found commercially practicable in the
United States, where the "medium pressure" torch
is sometimes called the high pressure. As we are
dealing entirely with the American use of the invention
we also will call the two kinds of torches used
here the low pressure and the high pressure.</p>

<p>The general principle of the torch is, as we see,
the mixture of oxygen with acetylene in order to
obtain a hotter flame, but right here we come to the
difference between the low-pressure and the high-pressure
tools. Both are made of brass pipes, terminating
in the burning tip and connected at the
rear of the handle with rubber tubes which run to
the separate tanks holding the acetylene gas and
the oxygen, but the method by which these gases
are combined in the torch constitutes the principle
differences in the two systems, with the consequent
greater or less efficiency claimed by the manufacturers.
Without going into the technical details,
which are a matter of controversy between scientists
as well as the various commercial concerns interested
in the torches, it will be sufficient to say that in the
low-pressure torch the acetylene gas is only used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
under a pressure of a few ounces, with the oxygen
under a much heavier pressure, while in the high-pressure
torches, the acetylene and oxygen both are
under an appreciable pressure of several pounds.</p>

<p>Thus in the low-pressure torch invented by Fouch√©,
the oxygen is forced out of the nozzle by the pressure
and the outrush sucks out the acetylene in the proper
quantities. The two gases mix in a chamber at the
end of the torch just above the tip and flow out into
the air in this mixed form. The proportions of the
gases in the low-pressure tool are about 1.7 of oxygen
to 1.0 of acetylene.</p>

<p>The high-pressure torch, which has largely taken
the place of the low-pressure one in France, and
which we also see most frequently in this country,
has a different method of mixing the gases, due to the
fact that they both are under pressure. According
to many authorities the tip where the gases are mixed
is by far the most important factor in the success
or failure of the tool. In the high-pressure torch
the oxygen enters the tip from a hole in the centre,
while the acetylene enters it from two holes, one on
each side. They meet under high pressure at the
upper end of the tip, and have the length of the
hollow tip in which to mix, before they strike the air.
The long, narrow hole in the tip is called the mixing
chamber. Those who are interested in the high-pressure
torch declare that it is the fact that the gases are
positively mixed in proper proportion in the detachable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
tip, that so greatly adds to the efficiency of the
tool. They declare that by allowing the acetylene to
enter the tip laterally, at right angles with the oxygen,
the blast of the oxygen is broken as it mixes with the
acetylene, and the tendency of an oxygen flame to
oxidize any metal with which it comes in contact by
reason of an excess of oxygen in the flame is largely
done away with. This, with the small diameter of the
mixing chamber and the friction with the walls, gives
a perfect mixture, according to the claims of the high-pressure
torch enthusiasts. Moreover, the small hole
which is the mixing chamber, effectually prevents serious
accidents by flash-backs of the highly explosive
acetylene, and also provides a much easier method
of control. Each outfit has several different sizes
of tips for various kinds of work.</p>

<p>The pressure under which the two gases are used
is the other big difference between the high-pressure
and the low-pressure torches, as said before. In the
the high-pressure tool the oxygen is compressed about
the same as in the low-pressure torch, while the
acetylene is under several pounds pressure, just in
accordance with the size of the tip used. In the
low-pressure torch the pressure on the acetylene
is only about ten ounces to the square inch, or only
enough to keep it flowing. On account of this
difference in the pressure making the big difference
in the mixture of the gases, scientists have chosen
to call the low-pressure torches injector mixture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
types, from the fact that the acetylene is sucked into
the tip by an injector system, while the high-pressure
torches are called positive mixture types, because
the gases are mixed directly by pressure. In the
latest high-pressure tool the mixture of gases is 1.14
parts of oxygen to 1 part of acetylene, while the low-pressure
torch takes a proportion of 1.7 parts of
oxygen to 1 part of acetylene.</p>

<p>The torches also vary in size from the little 8-ounce
"jeweller's" torch, that the scientist used,
to nineteen to twenty inches long and a weight of
two and a quarter pounds. The average size, however,
is twelve inches long with a weight of one pound.
The welding torch is made up of two brass tubes, one
for the acetylene and the other for the oxygen, connected
at the two ends. At the nozzle end there
is a sharp turn in the piping so that the tip is very
nearly at right angles to the main pipes. At the
handle end, are the connections for the rubber tubes
that lead to the gas tanks, and the little valves by
which the operator can control the flow of gas. The
pipes carrying the gases to the tip are the same
size the whole length, but at one end are enclosed
in a larger tube, which serves as a handle.</p>

<p>Now that we have seen the general construction
of the oxy-acetylene torches, we will assume that the
tanks, which look like large soda-water reservoirs,
are filled with pure oxygen and acetylene gas, and
transported to some convenient point in a railroad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
repair shop where great forges are spurting flames,
and one can hardly hear the talk of a man beside him
for the roar of the hammers and the compressed air
riveters. Assume that some large expensive steel
part of a locomotive has been broken and must be
repaired quickly so that the engine can go out on the
road to help haul an accumulation of freight.</p>

<p>In the old days an engine would have to be taken
apart, a new part turned out at the steel mill,
shipped to the shops, and the locomotive put together
again. Nowadays it is only necessary to
take enough of the machinery apart for the workmen
to get at the broken parts. After cutting
off the edges to be welded so that they make a
small V, and supporting them within the fraction
of an inch apart in the exact position and shape that
they are to be repaired, the workman selects a rod
of steel or iron, to use in somewhat the same way
the tinker uses a strip of solder when he wants to
repair a break in a kettle with solder and soldering
iron.</p>

<p>The selection of this filling rod, or wire, is all-important,
for the skilful and successful iron worker
uses a piece of metal that will fuse well with the
parts to be repaired, at about the same temperature
at which they themselves will fuse. Mild steel or
Norway iron which is 90 per cent. pure is frequently
used, but there are no hard and fast rules because
every master mechanic has his own ideas about such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
things, and would not take the word of any manufacturing
company.</p>

<p>Then the operator turns on his torch, lights it
with a match, takes it in one hand, and the rod of
welding steel in the other. Holding the end of the
steel rod at the thin crack or bevelled edges between
the pieces to be welded the operator directs the small
flame on the point, holding the tip of the torch about
a quarter to a half inch from the metal. It only
takes a few seconds for the terrific heat of the flame
to melt the strip of steel and the edges of the parts
to be welded so that they all are fused together in
one perfect mass.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, the brass tip of the torch
does not melt in this heat because the pressure behind
the gases forces them out with such velocity that the
flame is far enough removed from the tip to do it no
injury, just so long as the operator does not put the
tip square against the metal and drive the flame back
against it. This not only would melt the tip but
probably would cause a flash-back in the torch.</p>

<p>As the end of the strip melts into the crack the
operator moves up the steel, and moves his torch
along the crack until the whole operation is complete.
At the end the weld is very rough but when
it is machined down it may be so perfect that it is
difficult to tell where it was made, and the strength
is equal to that of any other part of the piece.</p>

<p>In other words, the weld becomes homogenous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
with the parts repaired. From this fact autogenous
welding takes its name. Autogenous is defined as
"self produced," or independent of outside materials.</p>

<p>Thus, we see that the autogenous process is a
system of putting on new material, without either
heating, compression, or adding flux (molten material)
to the broken parts. In the foregoing paragraphs
we have taken up the welding of steel parts,
but the process can be as well applied to steel pipe,
steel plate, iron, cast-iron, aluminum, copper, and
other materials with only slight variations in the
manner of using the torch.</p>

<p>The cutting process is even more spectacular because
while the welding proceeds quietly, the cutting
is accompanied by just enough fireworks to show
us the progress of the tiny flame through the hardest
and thickest of metals.</p>

<p>The cutting torch is the same as the welding torch
with the exception of an additional pipe from which
flows a jet of pure oxygen to give the flame the
necessary cutting property. The greater the supply
of oxygen the greater the combustion, and the more
penetrating the flame. The acetylene gas flame heats
up the steel&mdash;"fills the office of a preheater,"
said the scientist&mdash;while the oxygen jet follows close
behind and makes a thin cut through the hot metal.</p>

<p>The extra pipe is the same size as the others and
extends down to the end of the torch at an angle where
its tip is clamped alongside the main tip. The rear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
end of the third tube is connected with a rubber hose
like the others, which extends to the oxygen tank.
The flow of oxygen is under higher, and individual
working pressure, controlled by a valve. In a new
style torch the extra hose is done away with and
the separation of the oxygen is done in the torch.</p>

<p>When the modern steel carpenter wants to cut
a hole, or saw off a strip from a piece of steel, no
matter whether it be a steel beam, steel plate, or
almost any other form of iron (except cast-iron),
he attaches the cutting pipe, lights his torch and
sets to work. Holding the tool about half an
inch from the surface he directs the little blue
flame, which is no more than three quarters of an
inch long, and a quarter of an inch thick, against
the spot where he desires to start cutting. He
holds it there a few seconds, then there is a shower
of sparks on the under side of the steel plate,
indicating that the flame has eaten its way all
the way through. The operator next moves the torch
along the line where he wants to cut. The speed
with which he can move is governed by the thickness
of the steel to be cut. Half-inch ship steel,
for instance, could be cut at a rate of more than a
foot a minute. The heat of the flame melts a little
of the steel, which drops down in molten particles,
but the edge that is cut is sharp and clean, and its
temper is as perfect as if the cutting were done with
one of the laborious old-fashioned steel saws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
This cutting process is of especial value to navy
yards, shipyards, and wreckers, where there is a
great deal of steel to be cut. Uncle Sam uses it at
most of his navy yards, for in building his battleships
there are thousands and thousands of holes to be cut
in steel plates, plates to be shaped, and beams to be
cut off to required lengths.</p>

<p>When the scientist and his young friend visited
the Brooklyn Navy Yard to see this process in operation
the naval constructors had made considerable
headway on the framework of the great Dreadnaught
<i>New York</i>, in course of building there. The huge
steel ribs of the ship towered upward amid the
scaffolding nearly as high as a five-story building.
In laying this steel framework, and shaping the
plates that will make the hull, bulkheads, and decks,
there will be millions of holes to be cut, and virtually
miles and miles of plates to be shaped. Instead of
sawing these the workmen were cutting them with
the oxy-acetylene torches.</p>

<p>Half a dozen men were at work, all cutting as fast
as possible, and the great steel plates, and beams were
coming and going as quickly as ever boards were
passed along by a carpenter. The lines that were
to be cut were all marked out in advance so the
men never put out their torches. The only cessation
in the work was when one of them stopped for a
minute or so, to wipe his eyes, for in spite of the
dark goggles worn by all operators of the oxy-acetylene
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
process the intense flame is very hard on
the eyes.</p>

<p>One reason why the cutting process is so popular in
shipyards is because in making steel ships, holes are
cut in the plates, ribs, and beams, wherever possible
without lessening the strength, to lighten the frame.</p>

<p>Probably the most picturesque use of the cutting
device is by wreckers of steel structures. Nowadays
whenever there is a bad fire the building is left a tangled
mass of steel pipes and girders that can only be
cleared away with the greatest risk of life, and the
greatest difficulty. The process always was a long, tedious
one until the oxy-acetylene cutting came into use.</p>

<p>Thousands of New York boys saw the device in
use during the winter of 1911-1912 when they visited
the ruins of the Equitable Life Assurance Society
fire. The sight is unmistakable. Far up in the ruins
you see a man bending over a great twisted steel
beam that it might take weeks to pull out of the
d√©bris. Soon there is a shower of sparks, and the
part that is sticking out is cut off and ready to be
sent to the street and hauled away. The device
has been used in the ruins of a large number of
disastrous fires, lately, particularly where men have
been entombed in the collapse of ceilings, and haste
means everything in getting out their bodies. Also,
it was very successfully used in cutting up the old
battleship <i>Maine</i> before the hull was removed from
Havana harbour.</p>

<p>"I never heard of any real engine as small as that,"
said the boy. "I used to play with toy engines, but
they wouldn't give anywhere near one horsepower,
much less 110."</p>

<p>"No, it is a steam turbine, but if you know anything
at all about turbines you will see that it is
entirely different from any you ever have seen, for
Doctor Tesla has used a principle as old as the hills
and one which has been known to men for centuries,
but which never before has been applied in mechanics."</p>

<p>After a little more talk the scientist promised to
arrange with Tesla to take the young man over to the
great Waterside power-house, New York, where the
inventor is testing out his latest invention. We will
follow them there and see what this wonderful little
turbine looks like.</p>

<p>Picking his way amid the powerful machinery and
the maze of switchboards, the scientist finally
stopped in front of a little device that seemed like
a toy amid the gigantic machines of the power-house.</p>

<p>"This is the small turbine," says Tesla. "It
will do pretty well for its size."</p>

<p>The little engine looked like a small steel drum
about ten inches in diameter and a couple of inches
wide, with a shaft running through the centre.
Various kinds of gauges were attached at different
points. Outside of the gauges and the base upon
which it was mounted, the engine almost could have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
been covered by a derby hat. The whole thing,
gauges and all, practically could have been covered by
an ordinary hat box.</p>

<p>Yet when Tesla gave the word, and his assistant
turned on the steam, the small dynamo to which
the turbine shaft was geared, instantly began to run
at terrific speed. Apparently the machine began
to run at full speed instantly instead of gradually
working up to it. There was no sound except the
whir of well-fitted machinery. "Under tests," said
Tesla, "this little turbine has developed 110 horsepower."</p>

<p>Just think of it, a little engine that you could lift
with one hand, giving 110 horsepower!</p>

<p>"But we can do better than that," added the inventor,
"for with a steam pressure of 125 pounds at
the inlet, running 9,000 revolutions per minute, the
engine will develop 200 brake-horsepower."</p>

<p>Nearby was another machine a little larger than
the first, which seemed to be two identical Tesla
turbines with the central shafts connected by a strong
spring. Gauges of different kinds, to show how the
engine stood the tests, were attached at various
places. When Tesla gave the word to open the
throttle on the twin machines the spring connecting
the shafts, without a second's pause, began to revolve,
so that it looked like a solid bar of polished steel.
Outside of a low, steady hum and a slight vibration
in the floor, that steadied down after the engine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
had been running a little while, there was no indication
that enough horsepower to run machinery a
hundred times the weight and size of the turbine was
being generated.</p>

<p>"You see, for testing purposes," said Doctor
Tesla, "I have these two turbines connected by this
torsion spring. The steam is acting in opposite
directions in the two machines. In one, the heat
energy is converted into mechanical power. In the
other, mechanical power is turned back into heat.
One is working against the other, and by means of
this gauge we can tell how much the spring is twisted
and consequently how much power we are developing.
Every degree marked off on this scale indicates
twenty-two horsepower." The beam of light on the
gauge stood at the division marked "10."</p>

<p>"Two hundred and twenty horsepower," said
Doctor Tesla. "We can do better than that."
He opened the steam valves a trifle more, giving
more power to the motive end of the combination
and more resistance to the "brake" end. The scale
indicated 330 horsepower. "These casings are not
constructed for much higher steam pressure, or I
could show you something more wonderful than that.
These engines could readily develop 1,000 horsepower.</p>

<p>"These little turbines represent what mechanical
engineers have been dreaming of since steam power
was invented&mdash;the perfect rotary engine," continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
Doctor Tesla, as he led the way back to his
office. "My turbine will give at least twenty-five
times as much power to the pound of weight as
the lightest weight engines made to date. You
know that the lightest and most powerful gasoline
engines used on aeroplanes nowadays generally develop
only one horsepower to two and one half pounds
of weight. With that much weight my turbine will
develop twenty-five horsepower.</p>

<p>"That is not all, for the turbine is probably the
cheapest engine to build ever invented. Its mechanical
simplicity is such that any good mechanic could
build it, and any good mechanic could repair such
parts as get out of order. When I can show you the
inside of one of the turbines, in a few moments,
however, you will see that there is nothing to
get out of order such as most turbines have, and
that it is not subjected to the heavy strains and
jerks that all reciprocating engines and other turbines
must stand. Also you will see that my turbine will
run forward or backward, just as we desire, will run
with steam, water, gas, or air, and can be used as a
pump or an air compressor, just as well as an engine."</p>

<p>"But most of your research has been in electricity,"
Tesla was reminded, for no one can forget
that Tesla's inventions largely have made possible
most of the world's greatest electrical power developments.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, "but I was a mechanical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
engineer before I was an electrical engineer, and
besides, this principle was worked out in the course
of my search for the ideal motor for airships, to be
used in conjunction with my invention for the wireless
transmission of electrical power. For twenty
years I worked on the problem, but I have not given
up. When my plan is perfected the present-day
aeroplanes and dirigible balloons will disappear, and
the dangerous sport of aviation, as we know it now
with its hundreds of accidents, and its picturesque
birdmen, will give way to safe, seaworthy airships,
without wings or gas bags, but supported and driven
by mechanical means.</p>

<p>"As I told you before when we were talking of
the wireless transmission of power, the mechanism
will be a development of the principle on which my
turbine is constructed. It will be so tremendously
powerful that it will make a veritable rope of air
above the great machine to hold it at any altitude
the navigators may choose, and also a rope of air
in front or in the rear to send it forward or
backward at almost any speed desired. When that
day comes, airship travel will be as safe and prosaic
as travel by railroad train to-day, and not very much
different, except that there will be no dirt, and it
will be much faster. One will be able to dine in
New York, retire in an aero Pullman berth in a closed
and perfectly furnished car, and arise to breakfast
in London."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Tesla's plans for the airship are far in the future,
but his turbine is a thing of the present, and it has
been declared by some of the most eminent authorities
in the world in mechanical engineering to be the
greatest invention of a century. The reason for
this is not altogether on account of the wonderful
feats of Tesla's model turbines, but because in them
he has shown the world an entirely unused mechanical
principle which can be applied in a thousand
useful ways.</p>

<p>James Watt discovered and put to work the expansive
power of steam, by which the piston of an
engine is pushed back and forth in the cylinder of
an engine, but it has remained for Nikola Tesla
to prove that it is not necessary for the steam to
have something to push upon&mdash;that the most
powerful engine yet shown to the world works
through a far simpler mechanism than any yet used
for turning a gas or a fluid into the driving force of
machinery.</p>

<p>"How did you come to invent your turbine while
you were busy with your wonderful electrical inventions?"
Tesla was asked.</p>

<p>"You see," he answered, "while I was trying to solve
the problem of aerial navigation by electrical means,
the gasoline motor was perfected; and aviation
as we know it to-day became a fact. I consider the
aeroplane as it has been developed little more than
a passing phase of air navigation. Aeroplaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
makes delightful sport, no doubt, but as it is now it
can never be practical in commerce. Consequently
I abandoned for the time being my attempts to find
the ideal airship motor in electricity, and for several
years studied hard on the problem as one of mechanics.
Finally I hit upon the central idea of the
new turbine I have just been showing you."</p>

<p>"What is this principle?"</p>

<p>"The idea of my turbine is based simply on two
properties known to science for hundreds of years, but
never in all the world's history used in this way
before. These properties are adhesion and viscosity.
Any boy can test them. For instance, put a little
water on a sheet of metal. Most of it will roll off,
but a few drops will remain until they evaporate.
The metal does not absorb the water so the only
thing that makes the water remain on the metal is
adhesion&mdash;in other words, it adheres, or sticks to
the metal.</p>

<p>"Then, too, you will notice that the drop of water
will assume a certain shape and that it will remain
in that form until you make it change by some
outside force&mdash;by disturbing it by touch or holding
it so that the attraction of gravitation will make it
change.</p>

<p>"The simple little experiment reveals the viscosity
of water, or, in other words, reveals the
property of the molecules which go to make up the
water, of sticking to each other. It is these properties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
of adhesion and viscosity that cause the 'skin friction'
that impedes a ship in its progress through the water,
or an aeroplane in going through the air. All fluids
have these qualities&mdash;and you must keep in mind
that air is a fluid, all gases are fluid, steam is fluid.
Every known means of transmitting or developing
mechanical power is through a fluid medium.</p>

<p>"It is a surprising fact that gases and vapours are
possessed of this property of viscosity to a greater
degree than are liquids such as water. Owing to
these properties, if a solid body is moved through a
fluid, more or less of the fluid is dragged along, or if
a solid is put in a fluid that is moving it is carried
along with the current. Also you are familiar with the
great rush of air that follows a swiftly moving train.
That simply means that the train tends to carry the
air along with it, as the air tries to adhere to the surface
of the cars, and the particles of air try to stick together.
You would be surprised if you could have a picture
of the great train of moving air that follows you
about merely as you walk through this room.</p>

<p>"Now, in all the history of mechanical engineering,
these properties have not been turned to the full use of
man, although, as I said before, they have been known
to exist for centuries. When I hit upon the idea that
a rotary engine would run through their application,
I began a series of very successful experiments."</p>

<p>Tesla went on to explain that all turbines, and in
fact all engines, are based on the idea that the steam
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
must have something to push against. We shall see
a little later how these engines were developed, but
it will suffice for the moment to listen to Doctor
Tesla's explanation.</p>

<p>"All of the successful turbines up to the time of
my invention," he says, "give the steam something
to push upon. For instance"&mdash;taking a pencil and
a piece of paper&mdash;"we will consider this circle, the
disk, or rotor of an ordinary turbine. You understand
it is the wheel to which the shaft is attached,
and which turns the shaft, transmitting power to the
machinery. Now it is a large wheel and along the
outer edge is a row of little blades, or vanes, or
buckets. The steam is turned against these blades,
or buckets, in jets from pipes set around the wheel at
close intervals, and the force of the steam on the
blades turns the wheel at very high speed and gives
us the power of what we call a 'prime mover'&mdash;that
is, power which we can convert into electricity, or
which we can use to drive all kinds of machinery. Now
see what a big wheel it is and what a very small part of
the wheel is used in giving us power&mdash;only the outer
edge where the steam can push against the blades.</p>

<p>"In my new turbine the steam pushes against the
whole wheel all at once, utilizing all the space wasted
in other turbines. There are no blades or vanes or
sockets or anything for the steam to push against,
for I have proved that they hinder the efficiency of the
turbine rather than increase it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Comparing his turbine to other engines Tesla says,
"In reciprocating engines of the older type the
power-giving portion&mdash;the cylinder, piston, etc.&mdash;is
no more than a fraction of 1 per cent. of the total
weight of material used in construction. The present
form of turbine, with an efficiency of about 62
per cent., was a great advance, but even in this form
of machine scarcely more than 1 per cent. or 2 per
cent. is used in actually generating power at a given
moment. The only part of the great wheel that is
used in actually making power is the outside edge
where the steam pushes on the buckets.</p>

<p>"The new turbine offers a striking contrast using
as it does practically the entire material of the power-giving
portion of the engine. The result is an
economy that gives an efficiency of 80 per cent. to
90 per cent. With sufficient boiler capacity on a
vessel such as the <i>Mauretania</i>, it would be perfectly
easy to develop, instead of some 70,000 horsepower,
4,000,000 horsepower in the same space&mdash;and this
is a conservative estimate.</p>

<p>"You see this is obtained by the new application
of this principle in physics which never has been used
before, by which we can economize on space and
weight so that the most of the engine is given over
to power producing parts in which there is little
waste material."</p>

<p>Tesla then went on to explain the details of his
new turbine. Leading the way to a small model in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
his office he unscrewed a few bolts and lifted off the
top half of the round steel drum or casing. Inside
were a number of perfectly smooth, circular disks
mounted upon one central shaft&mdash;the shaft that extends
through the machine, and corresponds to the
crankshaft of an ordinary engine. The disks all
were securely fastened to the rod so that they could
not revolve without making it also turn in its carefully
adjusted bearings. The disks, which were only
about one sixteenth of an inch in thickness, and which
he said were constructed of the finest quality of steel,
were placed close together at regular intervals, so
that a space of only about an eighth of an inch intervened
between them. They were solid with the
exception of a hole close to the centre. The set of
disks is called the rotor or runner.</p>

<p>When the casing is clamped down tight, the steam
is sent through an inlet or nozzle at the side, so that
it enters at the periphery or outside edge of the set
of disks, at a tangent to the circle of the rotor. Of
course the steam is shot into the turbine under high
pressure so that all its force is turned into speed,
or what the scientists call velocity-energy. The
steel casing of the rotor naturally gives the steam the
circular course of the disks, and as it travels around
the disks the vapour adheres to them, and the
particles of steam adhere to each other. By the law
that Tesla has invoked, the steam drags the disks
around with it. As the speed of the disks increases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
the path of the steam lengthens, and at an average
speed the steam actually travels a distance of
twelve to fifteen feet. Starting at the outside edge of
the disks it travels around and around in constantly
narrowing circles as the steam pressure
decreases until it finally reaches the holes in the disks
at their centre, and there passes out. These holes,
then, we see act as the exhaust for the used-up steam,
for by the time the steam, which was shot into the
turbine by the nozzle under high pressure, reaches
the exhaust, it registers no more than about two
pounds gauge pressure.</p>

</div></div>

<p>For reasons which will be explained later, ordinary
turbines cannot be reversed, but Tesla's invention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
can run backward just as easily as forward. The
reverse action is accomplished simply by placing
another nozzle inlet on the other side of the rotor so
that the steam can be turned off from the right side
of the engine, for instance, and turned into the left
side, immediately reversing its direction, with the
change in the direction of the steam. The action
is instantaneous, too, for as we saw in the experiments
Tesla showed us, the turbine began to run at practically
top speed as soon as the steam was turned on.</p>

<p>The disks in the little 110-horsepower engine which
we saw, were only a little larger than a derby hat
were only nine and three quarter inches in diameter,
while in his larger turbines he simply increases the
diameter of the disks.</p>

<p>Tesla further explained that the 110-horsepower
turbine represented a single stage engine, or one
composed simply of one rotor. Where greater power
is required he explained that it would be easy to
compound a number of rotors to a double, or triple
or even what he calls a multi, or many stage, turbine.
In engineering the single stage is called one complete
power unit, and a large engine could be made up of
as many units as needed, or practicable.</p>

<p>"Then do you mean to say," Tesla was asked,
"that the only thing that makes the engine revolve
at this tremendous speed is the passage of steam
through the spaces between those smooth disks?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is all," he answered, "but as I explained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
before, the steam travels all the way from the outer
edge to the centre of the disks, working on them all
the time; whereas in the ordinary turbines the steam
only works on the outside edge, and all the rest of
the wheel is useless. By the time it leaves the exhaust
of my engine practically all the energy of the steam
has been put into the machine."</p>

<p>This is only one of the many advantages that
Tesla points out in his invention, for the turbine
is the exemplification of a principle, and hence more
than a mechanical achievement. "With a 1,000-horsepower
engine weighing only 100 pounds, imagine
the possibility in automobiles, locomotives, and
steamships," he says.</p>

<p>Explaining the large engines that he is testing,
one against the other, at the power plant, the
inventor said:</p>

<p>"Inside of the casings of the two larger turbines
the disks are eighteen inches in diameter and one
thirty-second of an inch thick. There are twenty-three
of them, spaced a little distance apart, the
whole making up a total thickness of three and one
half inches. The steam, entering at the periphery,
follows a spiral path toward the centre, where
openings are provided through which it exhausts.
As the disks rotate and the speed increases the path
of the steam lengthens until it completes a number
of turns before reaching the outlet&mdash;and it is
working all the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
"Moreover, every engineer knows that, when a
fluid is used as a vehicle of energy, the highest
possible economy can be obtained only when the
changes in the direction and velocity of movement
of the fluid are made as gradual and easy as possible.
In previous forms of turbines more or less sudden
changes of speed and direction are involved.</p>

<p>"By that I mean to say," explained Doctor Tesla,
"that in reciprocating engines with pistons, the
power comes from the backward and forward jerks
of the piston rod, and in other turbines the steam
must travel a zigzag path from one vane or blade
to another all the whole length of the turbine. This
causes both changes in velocity and direction and
impairs the efficiency of the machine. In my
turbine, as you saw, the steam enters at the nozzle
and travels a natural spiral path without any abrupt
changes in direction, or anything to hinder its
velocity."</p>

<p>But the Tesla turbine engine, claims the inventor,
will work just as well by gas as by steam, for as
he points out gases have the properties of adhesion
and viscosity just as much as water or steam.</p>

<p>Further, he says that if the gas were introduced
intermittently in explosions like those of the gasoline
engine, the machine would work as efficiently as it
does with a steady pressure of steam. Consequently
Tesla declares that his turbine can be developed for
general use as a gasoline engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
The engine is only one application of the principle
of Tesla's turbine, because he has used the same
idea on a pump and an air compressor as successfully
as on his experimental engines. In his office in the
Metropolitan Tower he has a number of models.
Pointing to a little machine on a table, which consisted
of half a dozen small disks three inches in
diameter, he said: "This is only a toy, but it shows
the principle of the invention just as well as the
larger models at the power plant." Tesla turned
on a small electric motor which was connected with
a shaft on which the disks were mounted, and it
began to hum at a high number of revolutions per
second.</p>

<p>"This is the principle of the pump," said Tesla.
"Here the electric motor furnishes the power and we
have these disks revolving in the air. You need
no proof to tell you that the air is being agitated
and propelled violently. If you will hold your hand
down near the centre of these disks&mdash;you see the
centres have been cut away&mdash;you will feel the
suction as air is drawn in to be expelled from the
outer edges.</p>

<p>"Now, suppose these revolving disks were enclosed
in an air-tight case, so constructed that the
air could enter only at one point and be expelled
only at another&mdash;what would we have?"</p>

<p>"You'd have an air pump," was suggested.</p>

<p>"Exactly&mdash;an air pump or a blower," said Doctor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Tesla. "There is one now in operation delivering
ten thousand cubic feet of air a minute."</p>

<p>But this was not all, for Tesla showed his visitors
a wonderful exhibition of the little device at work.
"To make a pump out of this turbine," he explained;
"we simply turn the disks by artificial means and
introduce the fluid, air or water at the centre of the
disks, and their rotation, with the properties of adhesion
and viscosity immediately suck up the fluid
and throw it off at the edges of the disks."</p>

<p>The inventor led the way to another room, where
he showed his visitors two small tanks, one above
the other. The lower one was full of water but the
upper one was empty. They were connected by a
pipe which terminated over the empty tank. At the
side of the lower tank was a very small aluminum
drum in which, Tesla told his visitors, were disks of
the kind that are used in his turbine. The shaft
of a little one twelfth horsepower motor adjoining
was connected with the rotor through the centre of
the casing. "Inside of this aluminum case are
several disks mounted on a shaft and immersed in
water," said Doctor Tesla. "From this lower tank
the water has free access to the case enclosing the
disks. This pipe leads from the periphery of the
case. I turn the current on, the motor turns the
disks, and as I open this valve in the pipe the water
flows."</p>

<p>He turned the valve and the water certainly did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
flow. Instantly a stream that would have filled
a barrel in a very few minutes began to run out of
the pipe into the upper part of the tank and thence
into the lower tank.</p>

<p>"This is only a toy," smiled the inventor. "There
are only half a dozen disks&mdash;'runners,' I call them&mdash;each
less than three inches in diameter, inside
of that case. They are just like the disks you saw
on the first motor&mdash;no vanes, blades or attachments
of any kind. Just perfectly smooth, flat disks revolving
in their own planes and pumping water because
of the viscosity and adhesion of the fluid. One such
pump now in operation, with eight disks, eighteen
inches in diameter, pumps 4,000 gallons a minute to a
height of 360 feet.</p>

<p>"From all these things, you can see the possibilities
of the new turbine," he continued. "It will
give ten horsepower to one pound of weight, which
is twenty-five times as powerful as many light weight
aeroplane engines, which give one horsepower of
energy for every two and one half pounds of weight.</p>

<p>"Moreover, the machine is one of the cheapest and
simplest to build ever invented and it has the distinct
advantage of having practically nothing about it
to get out of order. There are no fine adjustments,
as the disks do not have to be placed with more than
ordinary accuracy, and there are no fine clearances,
because the casing does not have to fit more than
conveniently close. As you see, there are no blades
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
or buckets to get broken or to get out of order. These
things, combined with the easy reversibility, simplicity
of the machine when used either as an engine, a
pump or an air compressor, and the possibility of using
it either with steam, gas, air, or water as motive power,
all combine to afford limitless possibilities for its
development."</p>

<p>Doctor Tesla calls the invention the most revolutionary
of his career, and it certainly will be if it
fulfils the predictions that so many eminent experts
are making for it.</p>

<p>It is interesting to think that although this latest
and most modern of all steam engines is a turbine,
the first steam engine ever invented, also was a
turbine.</p>

<p>Though most of us usually think of James Watt
as the inventor of the steam engine, he was not the
first by any means, for the very first of which history
gives us any record was a turbine, which was described
by Hero of Alexandria, an ancient Egyptian
scientist, who wrote about 100 B.C.</p>

<p>Hero's engine was a hollow sphere which was made
to turn by the reaction of steam as it escaped from
the ends of pipes, so placed that they would blow
directly upon the ball.</p>

<p>Centuries later&mdash;in 1629, about the time the New
England States were being colonized&mdash;a scientist
named Branca made use of the oldest mechanical
principle in the world&mdash;the paddle-wheel&mdash;which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
turned by the never-ceasing river, goes on forever
in the service of mankind. Branca's invention was
simply a paddle-wheel turned by a jet of steam instead
of by a water current. The engine was really
a turbine, for that type is simply a very high development
of this idea&mdash;the pushing power of a fluid
on a paddle-wheel.</p>

<p>The picture of Branca's crude machine shows the
head and shoulders of a great bronze man suspended
over a blazing wood fire. Evidently it is intended
to convey the idea that the figure's lungs are filled
with boiling water, for he is pictured breathing a
jet of steam on to the blades of a paddle-wheel, the
revolving of which sets some crude machinery in
motion.</p>

<p>After Branca, however, the turbine dropped from
view and what few inventors did experiment with
steam worked on the idea of a reciprocating engine.</p>

<p>The principle of the reciprocating engine, as
most boys know from their own experiments with toy
steam engines, and as was discovered by Watt, is
simply the utilization of the power of steam for expanding
with great force when let into first one side,
and then the other side of the cylinder. Thus, as
the steam expands, it pushes the piston back and
forth at a high rate of speed, transmitting motion
to shafts and flywheels.</p>

<p>In 1888 the world was ready for a bigger and more
powerful type of steam engine; and C. A. Parsons, an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Englishman, and Dr. G. de Laval of Stockholm,
brought forth successful turbines at about the same
time.</p>

<p>The machines were developed to a high state of
efficiency, and are still in general use, although most
turbines for driving heavy electrical machinery in
the United States are the great Curtiss engines, which
are a combination of the principles of both the De
Laval and Parsons machines. All of them are run
by the old principle of the water-wheel. Instead
of the steam being turned into a cylinder to
push the piston, it is turned into a steel drum or
casing in which wheels or disks are mounted on the
central shaft. All along the edge of these wheels
are hundreds of little vanes or blades or buckets
against which the steam flows from many nozzles
placed all around the inside of the casing. The steam
flows with great force, and naturally pushing against
the blades, starts the wheels and the engine shaft to
revolving. After expending its force on the blades
that turn the steam passes on to a set of stationary
blades which then shoot it out against the next set
of moving blades.</p>

<p>In the Curtiss turbine the wheels at one end of
the shaft are smaller than those at the other, and the
steam enters at the small end, where it is under heavy
pressure. After having expended its force on the
blades of the first wheel, the steam passes through
holes in a partition at the side and zigzags back so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
that it strikes the vanes or blades on the next larger
disk. It then repeats the process, expands a little,
and goes to a larger disk. Finally, by the time the
steam has expanded to its full capacity, the greater
part of its force has been expended against the disks
of the turbine.</p>

B¬¥&mdash;Steam exhausts. C&mdash;Moving blades. D&mdash;Stationary blades.</p>
</div></div>

<p>From this we see the main points of difference
between reciprocating engines and turbines, and
between most turbines and Tesla's invention.</p>

<p>While most turbines take advantage of the expansive
power of steam, the main idea is to make use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
of the velocity of the vapour as it is driven from a
set of nozzles around the turbine wheel, under high
pressure.</p>

<p>Also it will be seen that Tesla's invention is a
turbine in form, but that it is entirely different from
either of the two earlier types, because instead of
giving the steam something to push against, it is
allowed to follow its own natural course around
between the smooth disks, and drag them after it.</p>

<p>Some kind of a crank motion is necessary in all
reciprocating engines, to convert the backward and
forward movement of the piston to the rotary motion
of the shaft, but this is done away with entirely in
the turbine. What engineers call a "direct drive"
is substituted in its place. In other words, the turbine
wheels or disks, fastened to the shaft, turn it, and
drive the machinery directly from the source of power.
The speed of the machine is regulated by gears.</p>

<p>The great advantage of the "direct drive," particularly
for big steamships and for turning big electric
dynamos, will be plain to every boy when he thinks
of the long narrow body of a ship in which can lie the
turbine engines working directly on the propeller
shafts (with the exception of certain gears, of course,
for regulating the speed) instead of the big flywheels,
and flying cranks of marine reciprocating engines.
Also with dynamos it is just as important to have
the power applied directly to save space and increase
the general efficiency of the machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
The greatest disadvantage of the usual kinds of
turbines for most machinery, including steamships,
is the fact that they cannot be reversed. To solve
this difficulty, all the great ocean and coast liners,
battleships, cruisers, and torpedo boats that are
equipped with turbines have two sets of engines, one
for straight ahead and one for backward.</p>

<p>With the Tesla turbine this disadvantage, as we
have seen, is entirely done away with, and the one
turbine can be reversed as easily and simply as it
can be started.</p>

<p>And so, while we are waiting for the world-moving
wireless transmission of power and for the completion
of Tesla's invention for safe and stable airships,
we can look for the speedy development of his turbine
in practically all departments of mechanical engineering.</p>

epoch-making inventions let us follow our
friendly scientist and his boy companion to
one of the big cement shows held in the various large
cities of the United States every year, for a glance at
some of the uses of reinforced concrete in modern engineering
and building. For the boy who intends to
become a civil engineer this wonderful material will
have an especial interest, because its successful use
in all of the greatest engineering works going on
to-day has brought it to the front as the modern
substitute, in a great many cases, for wood, brick, or

<p> A LEVEL STRETCH OF CATSKILL AQUEDUCT</p>
<p>Showing completed section as well as forms for
the concrete.</p>
</div></div>

<p>On entering the cement show our friends saw on
every side long rows of booths showing models of
structures and articles that could be made of concrete.
There were models of houses, subways, dams, bridges,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
dock works, retaining walls, sewers, bridges, pavements
and even boats and furniture. In fact, so
the men in the exhibition booths said, concrete can
be used for practically every building purpose where
strength, lasting qualities, and resistance to heat and
cold are needed. "This is the concrete age," they
declared. "Concrete is fireproof, waterproof, sanitary,
and resists frost when properly used. Our
timber supply is decreasing, the supply of iron ore
for structural steel is limited, and stone is expensive;
so concrete, reinforced with steel, and used by engineers
who understand their business, will be the greatest
building material of the future."</p>

<p>These are the things that the enthusiasts at all the
concrete shows say, but they admit that there are
certain kinds of construction in which concrete is
not as effective as steel or granite. Also they say
that the use of reinforced concrete requires the
highest type of engineering skill, and a complete
understanding of the technicalities of the subject.</p>

<p>One of the places where we know concrete best is
in pavements and sidewalks, and several of the
booths exhibited samples of such work. To show
its strength the men in charge piled on weights,
struck the slabs with hammers, or subjected them
to any kind of hard usage suggested by the crowd.
Then, too, there were sections of concrete buildings,
and exhibitions of various systems of reinforced concrete
construction. With these there were concrete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
chimneys, portable concrete garages, railroad ties,
and what not.</p>

<p>"Oh, but look here," broke out the boy as he led
his older friend about. "Here's a perfect model of
a house."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the man, "that is a model of the
famous Edison poured cement, or 'one-piece' house,
the latest invention of our great American inventor."</p>

<p>There the little building stood, perfect in every
way, surrounded by a model concrete wall, a beautiful
lawn, and approached by fine concrete walks and
driveways.</p>

<p>"This model," explained the scientist, "represents
what Thomas A. Edison is trying to get time to
accomplish for workingmen and their families. Instead
of being built piece by piece, the house is supposed
to be made all at one time by pouring the
concrete into a complete set of moulds. This house
is so interesting that we shall look at it much closer
a little later on."</p>

<p>"And here," said the boy; "what's this?"</p>

<p>He had paused before a perfect model of the
Gatun locks of the Panama Canal, where the world's
greatest work in concrete, or any other kind of
masonry, is being carried on. The work is greater
than the Pyramids of Egypt or the Great Wall of
China. Though we will not bother ourselves much
with figures, it will give an idea of the size of the job on
the canal when we realize that it will require 8,000,000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
cubic yards of concrete, and more then 900,000 tons
of Portland cement.</p>

<p>In all there will be six great locks for the transportation
of our ships from the Atlantic to the Pacific
and back. Three of these locks are at Gatun on the
Atlantic side of the canal, one at Pedro Miguel, and
two at Miraflores. Each lock will be 1,000 feet long,
110 feet wide, and 45 feet deep&mdash;and practically all
of this is done with concrete. So massive is most of
the work that steel reinforcement is only necessary in
certain parts of the project. The problem of sinking
the great retaining walls to bedrock, and making them
strong enough to hold in the face of the tremendous
floods of the Chagres River, alone makes one of the
most stupendous engineering works ever undertaken
by man. Were it not for the use of concrete
the cost of the work would be so great as to make
it almost impossible of accomplishment.</p>

<p>The model of the Gatun locks showed the boy
everything, just as it will be when the canal is opened
for traffic in 1913. There was the wide Gatun lake,
surrounded by the tropical forests, the great Gatun
dam, and the series of locks in one solid mass of concrete.
These locks when completed will be 3,800
feet long, and their tremendous height and thickness
can be seen from the pictures of the work as it is
actually being carried on. In the model there were
perfect little ships on the lake and going through the
locks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Besides the many present day uses of cement
some of the concrete enthusiasts are suggesting
that heavily reinforced concrete be used in place
of steel in making bank vaults, as they declare
that the material will resist the keen tools and the
powerful explosives of bank robbers even more successfully
than the hardest steel.</p>

<p>Then too, at the cement show, the boy saw,
besides models of big works and examples of all
kinds of concrete construction, exhibits of the various
methods of placing steel bars and steel network
in the cement to make it stronger, and the
different machines used in mixing concrete and in
making Portland cement, which is the binding
element in concrete.</p>

<p>As concrete is a material that can be mixed by an
amateur and used for a great many purposes, the
booths where mixing and simple uses were demonstrated
attracted a great deal of attention. For
instance, in the last few years the farmers have found
out that they can make watering troughs, drains,
floors for stables, hen houses, and even fence posts,
of concrete just as easily as they can of wood or
iron. Moreover, the articles thus made will last
practically forever. All that is needed is a supply
of Portland cement, and a little careful study as to
the best way of mixing it with the proper amounts
of sand and gravel. The amateur has best results
if he starts modestly and takes up the use of reinforced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
concrete after learning how to use the
material in its simple form.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting uses of reinforced
concrete for the amateur who has learned something
of the craft is in making a good, seaworthy rowboat,
or even a small motor boat. Poured boats are strong,
graceful, and durable. If they are properly made
there never is any danger of their leaking, and by
a little extra pains it is possible to make them with
air-tight compartments so that they are non-sinkable.</p>

<p>The usual method of making concrete boats is
very simple. The kind of boat to be duplicated is
borrowed and hung on the shore so that it swings free
of the ground. Then a mould of clay is built all
around it. A strong bank of sand is heaped around
the clay, to hold it firm. Then the boat is worked
a little each way so that a space of about an inch
and a half is left all around between the outside of
the boat and the clay. The space between the boat
and the clay is the space into which the concrete is
poured for sides and bottom after the reinforcing
rods have been properly inserted. After the whole
thing has stood a day or so the inside boat is taken
out and the clay mould broken down, revealing a
complete concrete hull.</p>

<p>Thus, we see that concrete can be used as a building
material in practically any kind of construction,
that it is easily handled since all that is necessary
is to pour it into the moulds after the engineers have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
properly placed the reinforcement, and that it can
be cast in practically any decorative design just as
easily as plain. Add to this the fact that concrete
is cheaper than stone or steel, and that it is practically
indestructible when properly handled, and it is
easy to see the reason for calling this the cement age,
and concrete <i>the</i> building material of the future.</p>

<p>After the Panama Canal, the greatest engineering
feat in which concrete figures as one of the chief
materials used, is the Catskill aqueduct, by which
water from four watersheds in the Catskill Mountains
of New York State is to be piped to all five boroughs
of New York City. The Ashokan reservoir, near
Kensington, N. Y., was the first part of the work to
be taken up, together with the Kensico storage
reservoir twenty-five miles from New York, several
smaller reservoirs, and the aqueducts to carry this
water from the mountains to every home in greater
New York. The dam and containing walls of the
Ashokan reservoir are all made of reinforced concrete,
and the size of the lake and the strength of the walls
can be appreciated when one thinks that the 130,000,000,000
gallons of water it holds in check would
cover all Manhattan Island with twenty-eight feet
of water. A large part of the aqueduct proper,
through which this great stream of water is carried
from the mountains, under the Hudson River, and
to the city where it runs more than a hundred feet
below the street level, is made of reinforced concrete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
For other examples of the use of this material in
big engineering works a boy has only to look around
him. There are the tunnels under the rivers around
New York, the New York subways, the Philadelphia
and Boston subways, the Detroit River tunnel,
bridges, culverts, big piers and other dock works,
miles of concrete snowsheds along the lines of the
railroads that cross the continental divide of the
Rocky Mountains, and in fact practically every
big structural undertaking.</p>

<p>Almost anywhere we look these days we see a big
machine crushing rock, mixing it with sand and
mortar, and turning out concrete to be shovelled
into a hole and perhaps used far below the surface
by "sand hogs" working under compressed air, or
hoisted to the towering walls of some great office
building or factory that is being constructed of the
artificial stone.</p>

<p>We are familiar with the falsework of a concrete
building under construction. It is all, apparently,
a maze of wooden beams that look like scaffoldings,
and yet they seem to make the outlines of the building.
This maze of woodwork, seemingly so lacking
in plan or system, as a matter of fact is a triumph of
engineering skill, for it is the mould for the building,
and was all built by the most careful plans as to
strains, stresses, floor loads, etc.</p>

<p>First, however, before building the mould for a
residence, school, theatre, office building, or factory,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
the engineer decides what strength his foundations
must have. The foundation for a small residence
is an easy matter, but when it comes to a big factory,
or an office building of a dozen stories or so, the most
careful work must be done beforehand. In the old
days, when it was desired to sink the foundations of
a building down to bedrock, they used steel or wooden
piles, but these will rust or rot, and the modern way
is to use concrete piles. Either the great poles are
moulded first and sunk like the ordinary wooden
ones, or a pipe with a sharpened point is sunk and the
concrete deposited in it by buckets designed for the
purpose. Once these piles are driven, they are there
for all time, if the work is done properly, and the
engineer can be sure that his building is as good as
if resting on bedrock.</p>

<p>From then on the erection of a reinforced concrete
building is a most intricate matter, because while
concrete in itself is a very simple substance, its use
in buildings is a highly developed science. Of
course there are many different methods of using
concrete, and each one prescribes a different kind of
steel network for the reinforcement. Then, too,
some engineers cast parts of their buildings separately
and put them in place after they have set,
while others run the concrete for beams, floors, and
walls into moulds, built right where those parts are
to be in the finished structure. In laying the steel
reinforcing rods, before the concrete is poured, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
engineer sees that they make a perfect network so
as to take care of all the strains, just as they will be
put upon the building when it is completed. It is
in the proper placing of reinforcement that the greatest
engineering knowledge is needed in this kind of
building.</p>

<p>As the wooden moulds for the first foundation
beams and girders are completed and the reinforcement
is placed, the concrete is poured in. The subcellar
or cellar floor mould then is laid, the reinforcement
placed and the concrete run in. Next the
moulds for the cellar walls are built and perhaps the
moulds for the beams and girders for the first floor.
The reinforcing rods are placed in these moulds and
the concrete run in, and so on, a story at a time, or a
small section at a time, until the structure reaches
the height called for in the plans, and it stands completed.
As the building progresses and the concrete
on the lower floor sets, the moulds can be taken down
and used on higher stories. Concrete is even used
for the roofs of buildings, as it can be moulded right
in place or set up in slabs that can be later
cemented together.</p>

<p>When properly used reinforced concrete is absolutely
fireproof, so it is coming into extensive use in
the construction of schools, theatres, warehouses,
factories, and all other such buildings where a great
height is not required. So far, none of the great
skyscrapers has been built of reinforced concrete,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
although office buildings of sixteen stories have been
erected with complete success.</p>

<p>There is still another method of using concrete as
a building material. This is in the form of building
blocks, and doubtless all who read this will recall
seeing many beautiful residences built of blocks of
stone that on closer inspection proved to be concrete.
The blocks can be cast in any size or form and used
in just the same way as structural stone.</p>

<p>Now, after having looked about the city and having
seen the numerous ways that concrete is used as a
building material, we come back to the very latest
thing in the use of this man-made stone&mdash;the "one-piece"
or poured house.</p>

<p>For a good view of it let us take a little jaunt out
to West Orange, N. J., with the scientist and look
into the library of Thomas A. Edison's laboratory,
where we will see a perfect model of this marvel of
invention. It is practically the same as the one at
the cement show. Standing in the centre of the
great room where Edison works is this perfect little
cottage, about the size of a large doll's house. It
represents not only Edison's latest invention, but
also his favourite scheme. In years to come, when
the boys who read this are grown men, it will probably
be no novelty to build houses by pouring them
all at once into a steel mould, but just at present it
is one of the most startling developments in an age
of epoch-making inventions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
Every boy knows that Edison has never followed
the ideas of others in working out his inventions, and
the poured house is no exception to his rule. It will
be interesting to take a little look back over a part
of Edison's life and see how he came to enter the
cement-making business, and how, when he had his
process down to a fine point, he said to himself, "It
is cheap and easy to build a house or an office building
of concrete in sections, why not build it all in
one piece?"</p>

<p>We shall see that no sooner had he asked himself
this startling question than he began by making
models, and satisfied himself that it was not only
possible, but one of the cheapest and best methods
of making small, simply arranged houses, such as
could be bought or rented for a small sum.</p>

<p>Although Edison has within the last few years
brought his idea to a state where it can be put to
practical use, he himself is not trying to push it commercially,
as he has his other great inventions like
the phonograph, storage battery, and the motion-picture
machine. In fact, he is content to let it be
worked out by others just so long as it fulfills his
idea of giving to workingmen good houses at a low
price.</p>

<p>"Years ago, long before Edison had retired from
active business affairs to give his whole attention
to scientific research," said the scientist, as he and
the boy walked about the laboratory, "he became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
interested in metallurgy, just as he was and always
is interested in every other science where great difficulties
must be overcome. In those days iron and steel
were not used as extensively as they are now, but
the scientists and leaders in the big industries saw
that the day was coming when far, far greater
quantities of iron ore would be needed to supply the
great demand for steel to build skyscrapers, ships,
machinery, and so on. Men were going farther and
farther away in their search for iron ore, but Edison,
with his never failing originality, said to himself that
it was likely there was plenty of iron ore right around
his laboratory in New Jersey if he only knew how
to get at it.</p>

<p>"For one thing," continued the boy's friend,
"Edison had seen on the ocean beaches great
stretches of white sand with millions and millions of
little black particles sprinkled through them. He
knew that the specks were pure iron ore. You can
prove this to yourself by simply holding a good magnet
close to a pile of such sand, and watching the
iron particles collect."</p>

<p>It was Edison's idea to concentrate the iron ore
found in the earth, in just this way, for he had sent
out a corps of surveyors who had reported vast
quantities of low-grade ore in most of the Atlantic
Coast States. Low-grade ore is that which contains
only a small percentage of the metal desired, and
hence it does not pay to smelt it, unless a very cheap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
process can be found. Edison thought he had a
process cheap enough, for he simply intended to
grind the mountains to sand and take out the particles
of iron by running it through a hopper with a high-power
magnet at the mouth.</p>

<p>The process sounds simple, but the machinery
required was very complicated, to say nothing of
being extremely heavy. Edison set up his mill in the
mountains of New Jersey and started to blast down
the cliffs of low-grade ore and run them through a
series of gigantic crushers that ground them to a fine
powder. The iron particles, called concentrates,
after being extricated were pressed into briquets
ready for delivery to the foundry.</p>

<p>After having spent close to $2,000,000 on the
experiment, and satisfactorily proving its mechanical
success, the discovery of vast quantities of high-grade
ore in the Messaba range of Minnesota forced Edison
to close his plant. "This would have been a crushing
failure to most men," added the scientist, "but
Edison's only comment was a whimsical smile. Indeed,
even on his way home after closing his
plant, Edison was planning new and more important
activities, for with his experience at rock
crushing he was satisfied he could enter the field
as a maker of the building material called Portland
cement."</p>

<p>At that time cement and concrete were even less
used than were steel and iron, but Edison for many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
years had seen that in the future they would take
the place of wood, stone, and brick.</p>

<p>"Well-made concrete, employing a high grade of
Portland cement," said Edison on one occasion,
"is the most lasting material known. Practical
confirmation of this statement may be found
abundantly in Italy at the present time, where
many concrete structures exist, made of old
Roman cement, constructed more than a thousand
years ago, and are still in a good state of preservation.</p>

<p>"Concrete will last as long as granite and is far
more resistant to fire than any known stone."</p>

<p>But Edison had something more than a successful
business in mind when he returned from his rock-crushing
plant, for he intended setting up cement-making
machinery such as had never before been
seen. With this end in view he began to read up
on the subject, just as we have seen the Wright
brothers read up on aviation. Incidentally, as an
indication of the manner in which this wizard works,
it may be said that all this time Edison was perfecting
his new storage battery.</p>

<p>One big improvement upon the usual process in
the manufacture of cement, planned by Edison,
was that the grinding should be so fine that 65 per
cent. of the ground clinker should pass through a
200-mesh screen instead of only 75 per cent. as is the
usual rule. Thus, Edison made into cement 10 per
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
cent. more material that other manufacturers sent
back to be ground over again.</p>

<p>The success of Edison's Portland cement plant is
not matter for our attention here, so we will pass over
those busy years to the time of Edison's retirement
to devote all his time to scientific research.</p>

<p>For many years he had watched the cities grow,
had seen the great tenements become more crowded,
and less comfortable each year. He had seen the
children playing in the streets, and had compared
their lives to the happy lives of the children whose
parents could afford to live away from the great
cities, where boys could have yards to play in. He
decided that the boys of the city streets would have
a far better time, that their mothers and fathers
would have a far more cheerful life if they could live
in comfortable little houses in the country with yards,
and gardens, and plenty of room for every one.</p>

<p>Edison saw that what was needed was a building
material cheap enough, and a method of using it
cheap enough, so that dwellings could be put up at
a cost that would place them within the means of
workingmen and their families.</p>

<p>Concrete, he decided, was the material to solve the
problem, and Edison set himself to the task of making
houses poured complete into one mould so as to make
the cost of labour as low as possible. The "one-piece"
house was an assured thing from that time on. All
that remained was for the "Wizard of Orange," as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
he is called, to work out the difficult details of a properly
mixed cement and a practical system of moulds.</p>

<p>An incident that occurred at the time of the failure
of his ore crushing plant in the New Jersey mountains
was one of the things that brought the whole situation
home to him. When the plant was closed and
the buildings vacated, the fire insurance companies
cancelled the policies, declaring that the moral risk
was too great.</p>

<p>The inventor's reply was short and to the point.
He made no protest against the cancellation of his
policies, but simply said he would need no more
policies, as he would erect fireproof buildings in which
there would be no "moral risk."</p>

<p>This promise of Edison's, made at the time of his
so-called failure and pondered during the years of
his tremendous activities, was not redeemed until he
had retired from the business of invention as a means
of gaining riches. "I am not making these experiments
for money," Edison has said many times.
"This model represents the character of the house
which I will construct of concrete. I believe it can
be built by machinery in lots of 100 or more at
one location for a price which will be so low that it
can be purchased or rented by families whose total
income is not more than $550 per annum. It is an
attempt to solve the housing question by a practical
application of science, and the latest advancement in
cement and mechanical engineering."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Edison's plan, as we have seen before, was simply
to make a set of moulds in the shape of the house he
desired to build, run the concrete into them, let them
stand until the material had settled, and then take
down the retaining surfaces, exposing to view the
finished house.</p>

<p>It was contrary to all the previous ideas in building,
and was ridiculed by many famous architects.
Nevertheless, tremendous obstacles are the stuff
upon which Edison's genius feeds, and he only worked
the harder to produce a concrete that would be liquid
enough to fill all the intricate spaces and turns in the
moulds and yet sufficiently thick to prevent the sand
or gravel in the concrete from sinking to the bottom.
Thus, it first had to run like thin mush and then set in
walls and floors harder than any brick or stone.
Another of the difficulties to be overcome was to
discover a concrete that would give perfectly smooth
walls.</p>

<p>Although this may sound very simple, it has not
yet been completely worked out in this country,
owing to the heavy demands on Edison's time. The
perfected process, however, will be made known just
as soon as the inventor can find time to complete
certain small details that he wants to clear up before
giving the system to the world. A French syndicate
working along Edison's ideas for a poured house has
made some progress and it is reported they have
constructed two attractive dwellings with considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
success. One of these is at Santpoort,
Holland, and the other near Paris.</p>

<p>Whether the houses are poured completely in one
mould, or whether they are built a story at a time on
different days, this newest form of house building is
carried on along about the same lines.</p>

<p>"Let us just suppose," said the scientist, "that
we are standing on a building site in some pretty
suburb of a great city. We will also suppose that an
Edison poured house is to be erected there. Plans
are drawn beforehand for a small house of simple
arrangement and a set of steel moulds in convenient
sizes are turned out. These moulds all have connections
so they can be set up and joined together
in one piece. First, we see that a solid concrete cellar
floor, called the 'footing', has been laid down just
the size and shape of the house. A crowd of skilled
workmen quickly set up the moulds on this footing
and lock them together. The moulds make one
complete shell of the house, from cellar to roof, just
as it will appear when completed. Reinforcing rods
are placed in the mould so that they will be left in
the concrete walls, floors, etc., of the house after the
steel shell is taken away.</p>

<p>"Nearby we see a few more skilled workmen
mixing the concrete in great vats. When the mould
and the material are ready we see the concrete taken
to a tank on the roof and poured into troughs which
carry the stuff to a number of different holes through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
which it flows into the mould. We hear it splash,
splash, splash as it gradually fills every space in the
shell, and finally after six hours or so it overflows at
the roof. The main part of the work is now done
and we can go away for a few days while the liquid
in the shell sets, or turns to the hardest kind of stone.</p>

<p>"After about six days we return to see the moulds
unlocked, taken down and the complete house
standing ready with walls, floors, stairways, chimneys,
bathtubs, stationary tubs in the cellar, electric-wire
conduits, water, gas and heating pipes all complete.
In making the moulds the spaces for bathtubs, wash-tubs,
electric wiring and piping for gas, water, and
heat, are just as carefully arranged as walls and floors.
The only work necessary after the concrete has set
is to put in the doors and windows, install the
furnace and necessary fixtures for heating, lighting
and plumbing and connect them up ready for use.
No plaster is used in these houses, but the walls
can be tinted or decorated just as the landlord or
occupant desires."</p>

<p>The boy's friend went on to say that one might
think that this was about as far as science could
carry the use of concrete, but Edison said to himself:
"If we can make houses, why can't we make furniture?"
and he set about experimenting with poured
furniture. He obtained some wonderful results
with this newest use of concrete, and in his Orange
laboratory he has several cabinets, chairs, and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
articles of furniture that are every bit as attractive
to look at as wooden furniture and that are practically
indestructible.</p>

<p>"And my concrete furniture will be cheap, as well
as strong," says Edison. "If I couldn't put it out
cheaper than the oak that comes from Grand Rapids,
I wouldn't go into the business. If a newlywed
starts out with, say, $450 worth of furniture on the
installment plan, I feel confident that we can give
him more artistic and more durable furniture for
$200. I'll also be able to put out a whole bedroom
set for $5 or $6."</p>

<p>At present the weight of this concrete furniture
is about one third greater than wooden furniture,
but Edison is confident he can reduce this excess
to one quarter. The concrete surface can, of
course, be stained in imitation of any wood finish.
The phonograph cabinet shown at the left of Edison
in the picture opposite page <a href="#Page_281">281</a> has been trimmed
in white and gold. Its surface resembles enamelled
wood. The cabinet at his right is the old style
wooden type.</p>

<p>This concrete cabinet easily withstood the hard
usage of shipment by freight for a long distance.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Of course, the poured concrete furniture is made in
just the same way as the houses except that it is
a much simpler process. It is a very easy matter to
set up a steel mould for a chair, a cabinet, a dresser,
or a bedstead, whereas a house, with its tubs, conduits,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
stairways, hallways, doorways, window frames,
plumbing system, etc., is a most complex matter,
requiring a set of moulds that could be put together
properly by only a man who combined the highest
abilities of an architect, a builder, an engineer, and
a mechanic. Although concrete has been used for
many years in making garden furniture, Edison's
plan for making finished indoor pieces with it is
entirely new.</p>

<p>But to return to the houses; Edison says it is
just as easy to make poured dwellings in decorative
designs as in plain ones. It is only necessary to have
the moulds cast in the desired shape. It is his
idea to have all the poured houses pretty as well as
perfectly sanitary and substantial. He intends that
there shall be many different kinds of moulds, and also
that each set of moulds shall be so cast that it can
be joined in different ways, in order to give the houses
a variety of appearance. Thus, in a small town
where a large number of poured houses were set up,
there would be no two exactly alike if the owners
preferred to have them different.</p>

<p>According to the plans Edison now has on foot, the
first complete poured houses will have on the main
floor two rooms, the living room and dining room,
while on the second floor there will be four rooms,
a bathroom and hallway. Of course as the main idea
is to give perfectly sanitary and comfortable houses,
there will be plenty of windows, for lots of fresh air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
and sunlight. Edison figures that he can build a
house of poured concrete for $1,200 that would cost
$30,000 if built of cut stone. Furthermore, he
figures that the rent ought to be about $10 per
month, as he will only license reputable concerns to
use his patents, and his licenses will stipulate the
approximate rent that can be charged.</p>

<p>Thus, the high cost of living about which we all
hear so much at the family dinner table as well as
everywhere else is being attacked by science and
invention through a new channel, and Edison's
latest invention can be expected soon to give good
homes at low rents to thousands of families now paying
exorbitant prices for dark stuffy city flats.</p>

<p>It was significant that at the celebration of Edison's
sixty-fifth birthday, February 10, 1912, the
great American inventor should sit at the head of the
table surrounded by his family and associates facing
a perfect model of one of his poured cement houses.
The chair in which he sat, to all appearances was
beautiful mahogany, but in reality was cast in a
mould of Edison concrete at the Edison plant. At
the place of each guest was a bronze paperweight, appropriately
engraved, with Edison's favourite motto:</p>

<p>"All things come to him who hustles while he
waits."</p>

<p>HISTORY OF CONCRETE</p>

<p>Although concrete is in truth the newest building
material in our time, it is the oldest known to civilization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
because it was the stuff with which the eternal
buildings of ancient Rome were constructed. Even
before the Romans used concrete it was used by the
Eygptians, more than 4,000 years ago. Every boy
will remember from his history classes that the
Egyptians, so far as we can learn, were the first
people in the history of the world to reach a high state
of civilization. Every boy also will remember that
the only way we know this is through the evidence
of ruins of tombs and buildings. Many of these
buildings were made of a material very much like
concrete that must have been made in some such
manner as concrete is made nowadays.</p>

<p>About 2,000 years later, long after the Egyptian
civilization had died, the men of Carthage discovered
concrete for themselves and built a marvellous
aqueduct 70 miles long, through which water was
brought to their city. It was carried across a great
valley over about 1,000 arches, many of which are
still standing in good condition.</p>

<p>To the Romans, however, we are indebted for
some of the best examples of ancient concrete work.
They used this material in their wonderful city for
buildings, bridges, sewers, aqueducts, water mains,
and in fact in a great many of the ways that we have
seen it is used to-day. The great Coliseum and the
Pantheon at Rome are relics of the skill of the
ancient architects in the use of concrete.</p>

<p>Although many historians think that the secret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
of making cementious building material was lost
from the fall of Rome until the middle of the eighteenth
century, there are ruins of ancient castles
which stood in medi√¶val times in Europe which
indicate at least some use of concrete.</p>

<p>The real discoverer of natural cement in our
modern times though, was John Smeaton, who will
be remembered by the readers of "The Boy's Second
Book of Inventions" as the man who built the first
rock lighthouse at Eddystone, England, in 1756. In
his great work he discovered a kind of limestone with
which he could make a cement that would set, or
harden, under water. His discovery was hailed as
the recovery of the secret of the ancient Romans of
making hydraulic cement. It was so called because
it would harden under water.</p>

<p>In 1796, Joseph Parker, another Englishman, made
what he called Roman cement. Several others followed,
and in 1818 natural cement was first made in
the United States by Canvass White near Fayetteville,
N. Y. The material was made from natural
rock and was used in the construction of the Erie
Canal.</p>

<p>All of these early cements are called natural cements
by engineers nowadays, because they were
made from natural rock. It was only necessary to find
a clayey limestone which contained a certain percentage
of iron oxide and two other minerals known as silica
and alumina. The limestone was crushed to a convenient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
size and was burned in a kiln. The heat turned
the stuff into cinders which, when ground to a fine powder
and mixed with water, would make a cement that
would harden under either air or water very quickly,
and last for practically all time. Just for the sake of
those who have studied chemistry we will say that
in this process the heat drives off the carbon dioxide
in the limestone, and the lime, combining with the
silica alumina and iron oxide, forms a mass containing
mineral properties called silicates, aluminates, and
ferrites of lime. These properties mixed with the
water make natural cement. In the United States,
natural cement was called Rosendale cement, because
it was first made commercially in a town of New
York State by that name.</p>

<p>The supply of natural cement, however, is limited,
because the proper kind of limestone is only found
in a few places. Consequently, when an artificial
mortar called Portland cement was invented in 1824,
the world took a step forward that could not be
measured in those days.</p>

<p>Most authorities give the credit for the invention
to Joseph Aspdin, a bricklayer of Leeds, England.
He took out a patent on the material and in 1825
set up a large factory. In 1828 Portland cement was
used in the Thames tunnel, making the first time that
the material figured in any big engineering work. In
those days even the most enthusiastic supporters of
cement little dreamed that in this modern age it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
would be the material that would make possible such
tremendous victories over the obstacles of nature as
the Panama Canal, the tunnels under the rivers
that surround New York and the great dams that
hold back the waters all over the country.</p>

<p>Aspdin, however, is not given the credit for the
invention of Portland cement by all authorities, as
some claim that Isaac Johnson, also an Englishman,
who early in 1912 died at the age of 104, was really
the first man to invent a practical, commercial, artificial
cement.</p>

<p>The advantage in Portland cement is that it can
be made of a number of different kinds of earth, to be
found in many different parts of the world, and makes
a far stronger rock. It sets more slowly than natural
or hydraulic cement, but is more satisfactory for use
in reinforced concrete work. In the Lehigh Valley,
where about two thirds of the Portland cement used
in the United States is made, the raw material is a
rock, called cement rock, and limestone. In New
York State they make Portland cement of limestone
and clay; in the Middle West they make it of
marl and clay, while in other Western States they
make it of chalk and clay. In Europe slag is sometimes
used. The artificial product contains lime
oxide, silica, alumina, iron oxide, and other minerals
in varying quantities, but the necessary ones are
silica, alumina, and lime. In making Portland
cement the raw material is ground into a fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
powder and poured into one end of a long cylindrical
kiln which looks like a smokestack lying on
its side. Powdered coal is shot into the kiln,
where it is kept burning, at a heat of about
2,500 to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. After the raw
material has been burned thoroughly and is taken
from the kiln it looks like little cinders or clinkers
about the size of marbles. The cement clinker is
then cooled and ground to a powder, after which it is
stored away for a little while to season.</p>

<p>The first Portland cement ever made in the United
States was turned out by David O. Saylor, of Coplay,
Pa., in 1875, but the development of the new industry
was very slow, as builders and engineers seemed to be
blind to the great possibilities of the material that
built Imperial Rome. In 1890, nearly twenty years
after the process was introduced in America, only
335,500 barrels of Portland cement were manufactured
in this country. The country woke up to
the situation a few years later, and in 1905 there were
manufactured in the United States 35,246,812 barrels
of Portland cement. In 1911 the industry turned out
the stupendous total of 77,877,236 barrels.</p>

<p>This was because the age of concrete had dawned
on the world and man had learned in those years
that by mixing gravel and sand with cement he could
make a material cheaper, more easily handled, and
far more lasting than wood, brick or some stone.</p>

<p>As Edison once said to some of his associates:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
"I think the age of concrete has started, and I
believe I can prove that the most beautiful houses
that our architects can conceive can be cast in one
operation in iron forms at a cost, which, by comparison
with present methods, will be surprising. Then
even the poorest man among us will be enabled to
own a home of his own&mdash;a home that will last for
centuries with no cost for insurance or repairs, and
be as exchangeable for other property as a United
States bond."</p>

<p>The technical definition of concrete is as follows:
"Concrete is a species of artificial stone formed by
mixing cement mortar with broken stone or gravel.
Cement is the active element called the <i>matrix</i> and
the sand and stone forms the body of the mixture
called the <i>aggregate</i>."</p>

<p>The ingredients are mixed in different proportions
for different work. A common proportion is 1 part
cement, 2 parts sand, and 5 parts broken stone or
gravel. Cement users speak of this as a "1: 2: 5
mixture." Sometimes the gravel is left out and a
mixture of 1 part cement to 3 or 4 parts sand is
made. The cement binds the mass together and
sand fills up any little vacant spaces about the gravel,
making what is called a dense mixture.</p>

equipped with wireless, and a regular navy wireless operators' school is
maintained at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.</p>
</div></div>

<p>From the use of concrete it was only a short step
to reinforced concrete, or, concrete braced on the
inside with iron or steel rods. It is sometimes called
concrete steel, ferro-concrete, and armoured concrete.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
If we asked an engineer the idea in using reinforced
concrete he might say to us that the steel when
imbedded, united so closely with the concrete as to
form one single mass of very great strength. Steel
rods add to the <i>tensile</i> strength of concrete which
alone has a tremendous strength under <i>compression</i>.
In other words, steel does not break nor stretch
easily; that is, it has great tensile strength. Concrete
has great strength under compression; that is, it will
hold up an enormous weight without crushing. Thus,
a concrete beam alone might crack on the bottom,
because it has not as great tensile strength as steel.
But, if we put steel rods into a concrete mould, an
inch or so from the bottom, turn out a reinforced
concrete beam, for instance, and place it in the building,
with the reinforcement at the bottom, we use
a beam in which the strength of the concrete and iron
is combined. Thus, when a great weight is placed
on the top of the beam the concrete resists the compression
of the weight, and the reinforcement at the
bottom, by its tensile strength, prevents the beam
from cracking where the strain of the weight is
greatest.</p>

<p>That is what the engineer might tell us is the theory
of reinforced concrete, and the practice requires the
highest engineering skill and technical knowledge,
but in the simplest terms, it is concrete, braced by an
imbedded skeleton of steel. In actual practice
the reinforcing rods run both ways, or diagonally,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
just as the engineers decide it is necessary to resist
the particular kind of stress that the wall or beam
must withstand.</p>

<p>Reinforced concrete was first used, so far as
known, by M. Lambot, who exhibited a small
rowboat made of that material at the World's
Fair in Paris, in 1855. The sides and bottom of the
boat were 1-1/2 inches thick, with reinforcement of
steel wires. The boat is still in use at Merval,
France. F. Joseph Monier, however, is called the
"father of reinforced concrete," as he took out the
first patent on it in France in 1865. Monier was a
gardener and had experimented with large urns for
flowers and shrubs. He wanted to make his pots
lighter but just as strong, so he tried making some of
concrete with a wire netting imbedded in the material.
But even then the world did not realize that his
accomplishment was more important to mankind
than a great many of the wars that had been fought,
and little was done with concrete as a building material
until the Germans developed it.</p>

<p>Reinforced concrete was not used in the United
States, according to the best records, until 1875,
when W. E. Ward, without having studied the subject
very carefully, built himself a house of it, in
Port Chester, N. Y. He made the whole thing,
including foundation, outside walls, cornices, towers,
and roof of reinforced concrete, placing the steel rods
where his own good judgment told him they would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
do the most good. About this time the Ransome
Cement Company began to use the material for
building, and put up a great many strong and
beautiful structures, still to be seen in California and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Finally, bit by bit, in the face of opposition of all
kinds, reinforced concrete came to be recognized by
architects, engineers, and builders as one of the best
materials for certain kinds of work. To-day we
find that most of the predictions of the early enthusiasts
have been fulfilled and that the age of
concrete has dawned. That it will be used even
more extensively in the future, as men learn more and
more about this wonderful artificial stone, is certain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
THE LATEST AUTOMOBILE ENGINE</h2>
</div>

<p class="hanging">OUR BOY FRIEND AND THE SCIENTIST LOOK OVER THE
FIELD OF GASOLINE ENGINES AND SEE SOME BIG
IMPROVEMENTS OVER THOSE OF A FEW YEARS AGO</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">W</span>HILE we are following the conversations
of the scientist and his young friend about
new inventions, we must not overlook some
of their most interesting times in keeping abreast of
the vast improvements that are being made every
year&mdash;almost every day&mdash;in the inventions of a
dozen years ago.</p>

<p>For instance, there is the gas engine. Ten years
ago it was a very imperfect machine, as every boy
who has heard the old jokes about "auto-go-but
doesn't," "get a horse," etc., will remember.</p>

<p>Then there is the wireless telegraph. No invention
of recent years has shown a more remarkable development
than that of Guglielmo Marconi for sending
messages without wires.</p>

<p>But these are only a few of the things that the
two friends talked about. They looked into the
wonderful advancement in the art of photography
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
about which every boy knows something, and they investigated
the latest achievements of science in
electric lighting. Ten years is a very short time,
even in this fast moving age of ours, and we shall
see that many inventions made years ago are still
being worked upon by the original inventors and
others.</p>

<p>First, let us see a few of the ways the gas engine
has been improved, for we are all more or less familiar
with it in automobiles, motor boats, or the hundred
and one other places that it has become an invaluable
aid to man in carrying on the world's work.</p>

<p>Our young friend brought up the subject one day
when he asked the scientist for a few pointers on
getting better results with his motor-boat engine.</p>

<p>"We will look it over together," said the man.
"Of course you know that every gasoline engine has
its own peculiarities, and crankinesses, so it's hard
to tell just what's the matter with one until you see
it. I don't know very much about them; I wish I
knew more, but I have been talking with my automobile
friends a good deal lately about the new motor
invented by Charles Y. Knight."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," replied the boy, "it is called the
'Silent Knight' motor because it doesn't make any
noise, and it is used on a great many high-priced
automobiles."</p>

<p>"That's it. If you like we will go and have one
of these engines explained to us. At any rate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
automobile man can tell you more about your motor-boat
engine than I can."</p>

<p>The expedition was made shortly after the conversation.
"You understand, of course," said the
scientist on the way, "that the Knight motor represents
only one of the many, many improvements
in the gas engine, but it is what we call a fundamental
improvement, as it is a development in the main
idea of the gasoline motor, rather than merely an
improvement of one of the parts. Most of the
evolution of gas engines has consisted merely of the
improvement and perfection of the various parts for
more power, and more all around efficiency.</p>

<p>"You remember what you found out about gasoline
motors in general when we were spending so
much time talking about aeroplanes. The high speed
motor, as we know it now, was invented, you
know, by Gottlieb Daimler, a German inventor, in
1885, and with the ordinary four-cycle engine it
takes four trips, or two round trips of the piston
rod, to exert one push on the crankshaft of the engine.
In other words, the explosion drives down the piston
giving the power, and on its return trip the piston
forces out the burned fumes. On the next downward
stroke the fresh vapour is sucked into the
cylinder and on the fourth trip, or second upward
trip, the gas is compressed for the explosion. The
carbureter on your motor-boat engine, and all others,
as you know, is the device that mixes the gasoline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
with air and converts it into a highly explosive
gas, and the sparking system is the electrical device
that ignites the gas in the cylinders for each explosion
which makes the 'pop, pop, pop' so familiar with all
gasoline engines.</p>

<p>"In the old gas engines the ignition was derived
from a few dry-cell batteries and some sort of a transformer
coil, whereas nowadays the magneto takes care
of this work. As you know there are many kinds
of magnetos, and inventors have spent years working
out better and better ones. Also, in the old
style motors the carbureter was more or less of a
makeshift, with a drip feed arrangement, and a hand
regulating shutter for admitting the air. Now a
special automatic device regulates this, so that it is
no longer a toss up whether the gas is mixed in the
proper quantities or not. Then, too, the oiling
systems have been improved, so that the function
is done automatically. In short, the motor has been
made a perfectly reliable servant instead of a very
capricious plaything.</p>

<p>"All these improvements made no fundamental
change in the valves through which the gas was admitted
to the cylinders, and the exhausted vapours
expelled&mdash;and from your own experience you know
that you are just about as apt to have trouble with
your valves as with any other part of your machine.</p>

<p>"It is in these valves that the Knight motor
departs from the usual style, and by this it eliminates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
the well-known 'pop, pop, pop' by which gas engines
have been known all over the world."</p>

<p>As they looked over the engine, an expert in gasoline
motors explained all the parts of the "Silent
Knight" and showed the scientist and his boy friend
just how the machine worked.</p>

<p>He said that the only big difference between the
Knight motor and other standard makes of engines
is that the Knight substitutes for the intake and exhaust
valves an entirely new device composed of
two cylinders, one within the other, sliding upon
each other so as to regulate the flow of gas and the
exhaust of fumes.</p>

<p>Early in his career as an inventor, while living in
his home city of Chicago, Knight decided that gasoline
engines had entirely too many parts&mdash;that they
were too complicated&mdash;and he set about trying
to simplify them. For one thing, he made a careful
study of valves, and collected a specimen of every
kind known to mechanics. The sliding locomotive
valve seemed to him to hold the greatest possibilities
for his work, and he began a series of experiments
with sliding valves until he finally brought out his
first engine in 1902.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, Knight's work was not recognized
in his own country until after he had gone
to Europe, where his engine was taken up by some of
the biggest automobile manufacturers of England,
France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. After that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
it was taken up in the United States, and only now
is coming to be generally known. The inventor now
lives in England, where he was first successful, and
he is still at work on improvements of his engine.</p>

<p>The motor expert went on to explain that the advantage
of the Knight motor lay in the fact that the
two sleeves or cylinders, which go to make up the
combustion chamber or engine cylinder, sliding
up and down upon one another, give a silent, vibrationless
movement, as against the noisy action of the
old style poppet or spring valve motors.</p>

<p>"But," interrupted the boy, "there are lots of
other engines that run without making a noise nowadays."</p>

<p>"That is true," the man answered, "but most of
them run quietly only when at low speed, or stationary.
When they begin to hit the high places the
noise of the poppet valves is very noticeable. A few
years ago, when most engine builders were satisfied
to make motors that would run, regardless of noise,
they paid no attention to some of the finer mechanical
problems, but since they have become more
skilful, they are cutting down on the noise. But,
as I say, the explosions are plainly heard when these
engines are running at high speed. With the 'Silent
Knight' the only noise is that of the fan and magneto,
whether at low speed or the very fastest the motor
can run. There can be no noise, for there is nothing
for the sleeves to strike against."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
The expert then went on to explain the motor in
detail. The combustion chambers of the four or
six-cylinder "Silent Knight," he explained, are made
up of two concentric cylinders or sleeves, or, in other
words, one cylinder within another. There is only
the smallest fraction of an inch between them, and
as they are well oiled by an automatic lubricating
device they slide up and down upon each other with
perfect ease. Of course the sleeves, which are made
of Swedish iron, a very fine material for cylinder
construction, are machined down inside and out so
that they are perfectly smooth to run upon each
other.</p>

<p>The two sleeves which go to make up one cylinder
work up and down upon each other by means of a
small connecting rod affixed to the bottom of each
sleeve connected to an eccentric rod, which is driven
by a noiseless chain from the engine shaft.</p>

<p>The most important features are the slots cut in
each side, and close to the upper end of each sleeve,
so that, as the sleeves move upon one another the
slot in the right-hand side of the inner one will pass
the slot of the right-hand side of the outer sleeve, and
also the same with the left-hand side.</p>

<p>Then when the left-hand slots of the outer sleeve
open upon, or come into register with the left-hand
slots of the inner sleeve, a passage into the cylinder
is opened for the new gas to enter. When a charge
of gas has been drawn into the cylinder, one sleeve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
rises while the other falls, so that the openings are
separated and the passage is tightly closed. The
compression stroke then begins with the piston
rising to the top. At this juncture the igniting spark
explodes the compressed gas and the downward or
power stroke takes place. During the upward compression
stroke and the downward impulse stroke the
slots have been closed, allowing no opportunity for
the gas to escape. When the explosion has taken
place and the piston has been driven to the bottom
of its stroke, the right-hand openings in the inner
sleeve and those of the outer sleeve come together,
providing a passage for the exhausted gases to
escape with the fourth or exhaust stroke. Thus
it is plain that the motor is of the four-cycle type
and it should not be confounded with two-cycle
motors.</p>

<p>As the expert explained the motion he showed how
it was carried out on an engine from which the casing
had been partly removed. The careful mechanical
adjustment of the eccentric shaft, which operated the
connecting rods that pull the sleeves of the cylinder
up and down so that the openings for the entrance
of the fresh gas and the expulsion of the exploded
fumes come together at just the proper second, was
what took the boy's eye.</p>

<p>In connection with this the scientist handed the
boy a magazine to read. It was a copy of the <i>Motor
Age</i> in which an expert said editorially:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>"Those who pin their faith to the slide-valve motor
do so for many reasons, chief of which is that with
this motor there is a definite opening and closing of
the intake and exhaust parts, no matter at what
motor speeds the car be operating. Two years ago
one of the leading American engineers experimented
with poppet valves and discovered that frequently
at the high speeds the exhaust valves did not shut,
there not being sufficient time owing to the inability
of the valve spring to close the valve in the interval
before a cam returned to open it again. With such
a condition it is certain that the most powerful mixture
was not obtained. With the sleeve valve such
failure of operation cannot be, because no matter how
fast the motor is operating there is a definite opening
and closing for both intake and exhaust valve.</p>

<p>"It is a well-known fact that with poppet valves
the tension of the springs on the exhaust side varies
after five or six weeks' use, and consequently the
accuracy of opening and closing is interfered with.
Carbon gets on the valve seatings and prevents proper
closing of the valve, with the result that the compression
is interfered with and the face of the valve injured.
These troubles are, as far as can be learned,
obviated in the sleeve valve."</p>
</div>

<p>The friends of the Knight motor claim that it is
simpler than the ordinary types of engines, having
about one third less parts, that it is economic, powerful,
and, as previously pointed out, runs silently.
Beside these advantages, there are claimed for it
many technical virtues that we need not enter into
here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
The lubricating system of the Knight motors is
another interesting point, as it serves to illustrate
one more way in which the gasoline engine has been improved
upon of late years. The manner of oiling used
is known as the "movable dam" system. Located
transversely beneath the six connecting rods are six
oil troughs hinged on a shaft connected with the
throttle. With the opening and closing of the throttle
these troughs are automatically raised and lowered.
When the throttle is opened, which raises the troughs,
the points on the ends of the connecting rods dip
deep into the oil and create a splashing of oil on the
lower ends of the sliding sleeves. These sleeves are
grooved circularly on their outer surfaces in order
to distribute the oil evenly, while toward the
lower ends holes are drilled to allow for the passage
of oil.</p>

<p>When the motor is throttled down, which lowers
the troughs, the points barely dip into the oil and a
corresponding less amount of oil is splashed. An oil
pump keeps the troughs constantly overflowing.</p>

<p>The motor is cooled by a complete system of water
jackets, and it is fitted with a double ignition system,
each independent of the other.</p>

<p>Of course in the adoption of the sliding sleeve type,
mushroom valves, cams, cam rollers, cam shafts, valve
springs, and train of front engine gears all are eliminated,
the sliding parts fulfilling their various functions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Before Mr. Knight ever achieved success with his
motor it was subjected to some of the severest tests
on record in the whole automobile industry. In
France, Germany, and England, it was only accepted
by the leading manufacturers after being tried out
for periods extending over several months of the
hardest kind of usage. Now, that it has proven itself
a practical success, automobile men declare that the
sliding valve principle, never before applied to gas
engines until Knight began work, will undoubtedly
have a lasting effect on the whole industry.</p>

<p>The compact little two-cycle motors represent
another big fundamental development in the field
of gas engines. There are many different makes of
two-cycle motors, of course, and all have their various
merits. They are used in practically all the work
for which gas engines are employed, including automobiles,
motor boats, and aeroplanes. It will not
be necessary to describe these engines further than
to say that the name describes the fundamental
difference between them and the four-cycle motors.
Instead of the piston making four strokes for every
explosion&mdash;that is, an, upward stroke to clean out
the burnt vapours, a downward stroke to suck in
the fresh gas, an upward stroke to compress it, and
finally the downward explosion or power stroke, all
this work is done in two strokes.</p>

<p>For the general development of the gasoline engine,
it is only necessary for a boy to look about him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
Everywhere motors built on the same ideas as laid
down in earlier inventions, but improved in every
detail, are in use. Not only do we see them on fine
pleasure automobiles, motor boats, and aeroplanes,
but on our biggest trucks, fire engines, and in business
establishments where light machinery is to be run.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
THE WIRELESS TELEGRAPH UP TO THE<br />
MINUTE</h2>
</div>

<p class="hanging">THE SCIENTIST TALKS OF AMATEUR WIRELESS OPERATORS&mdash;THE
GREAT DEVELOPMENT OF WIRELESS
THAT HAS ENABLED IT TO SAVE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND
LIVES&mdash;LONG DISTANCE WORK OF THE MODERN
INSTRUMENTS</p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">W</span>HILE the inspiring stories of Jack Binns
of the steamship <i>Republic</i>, and of J. G.
Phillips and Harold S. Bride of the ill-fated
<i>Titanic</i> are fresh in our minds, it is not necessary to say
that within the last few years the wireless telegraph
has established itself as indispensable to the safe navigation
of the seas. The story of its development is
a marvellous one when we think that it was only in
December of 1901 that Marconi received the first
signal ever transmitted across the Atlantic Ocean
without wires. Now, as every boy knows, all the big
steamships are equipped with wireless, all the governments
of the world operate their own stations to
communicate with their warships, at sea, and thousands
upon thousands of boy amateurs operate their
own little plants with complete success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
More wonderful still is the story when we think
that by the use of this invention a total of about three
thousand persons have been saved from death in
shipwrecks. Nowhere in the pages of all history
are there any more thrilling stories of heroism and
devotion to duty than those of the men who, in the
face of death themselves, have stuck by their keys
sending out over the waves the "C. Q. D." and the
"S. O. S." signals, which as every boy knows are the
wireless calls for help.</p>

<p>The scientist and his boy friend never tired of talking
of these things, for the young man was one of the
many amateurs who had mastered the art, so that
many a night as he sat at his receiver he caught the
messages of steamships far out on the broad Atlantic,
and heard the Navy Yard station transmitting orders
to Uncle Sam's ships at sea.</p>

<p>One day shortly after the <i>Titanic</i> disaster the
boy said to his friend: "I saw by the paper to-day
that they are talking of passing a law to prevent the
amateur wireless operators from working. I don't
think they ought to do that. I'm sure most amateurs
never interfere with any signals, as was said they did
in connection with the messages to and from ships
that went to the rescue of the <i>Titanic</i>."</p>

<p>"So long as the amateurs do not have powerful
sending apparatus," answered the scientist, "I don't
think they will make any serious trouble, for it
makes no confusion to have them 'listening in' on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
the passing radiographs. Of course with a powerful
sender a mischievous person could work irreparable
damage by sending fake messages of one kind or
another. In fact there have been several instances
of messages that were thought to be fakes, but I
am sure no boy with the intelligence to rig up a wireless
outfit, would be so lacking in understanding of
his responsibilities as to try to confuse traffic.</p>

<p>"But it would be a shame to stop the amateurs
altogether," he continued, "for, no matter what the
companies may say, the wireless telegraph is still
in an experimental stage, and we must look to the
bright boys who are studying it now, for its greatest
development. The marvellous strides in improving
the apparatus, and solving the mysteries of electro-magnetic
currents, that have been made in the last
dozen years, should be eclipsed in the next decade,
if young men with some practical experience and a
desire to get at the real scientific basis of the art,
work at it."</p>

<p>"What are some of the main improvements of the
last few years?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>For answer, the scientist and the boy made a
journey down to the steamship docks, and visited
the wireless cabins of several of the big transatlantic
liners. They also went to the Brooklyn Navy Yard,
where there is a wireless school, that turns out Navy
operators after a thorough course in all the various
branches of the art. While on vacations to the seashore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
the youth had visited some of the big high-power
stations that send and receive messages to and
from the ships at sea.</p>

<p>In talking to the operators and electricians the
boy learned much about the wide extent to which
wireless is used nowadays. The law passed by
Congress in the United States in 1911, making it
necessary for every passenger steamer sailing from
American ports with fifty or more passengers, to carry
a wireless outfit capable of working at least 100
miles, in charge of a licensed operator, capable of
transmitting 20 or more words a minute, did a great
deal to increase the use of wireless. Also, not only
the actions of one government but the concerted
action of all the civilized nations represented at
the various international wireless conferences have
brought it to the official notice of the whole world.</p>

<p>Thus it has become a commercial reality on the
sea, and the Great Lakes, and also it has become
a big factor in war. All of the nations, besides having
their warships equipped with wireless, now have
wireless squads in the army, and have small compact
apparatus that can be transported in small wagons,
or even on horses' backs. These portable army
wireless outfits are very valuable for the communication
between detachments of an army, particularly
in places where there are few disturbing elements to
intercept the electro-magnetic waves.</p>

<p>In the recent campaign in Tripoli, in the war between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Italy and Turkey, the wireless was extensively
used by the Italian army in the field, and it was found
that the messages radiated over the desert just about
as well as over the sea. Of course as will be seen
later, it is not meant here to convey the idea that
wireless cannot be sent over the land, for the electro-magnetic
waves travel through the ether in every
direction, and as the ether fills the whole universe,
mountains, buildings, or water just as well as the air,
the waves are thought to go through obstacles as well
as over water. The difficulty in sending over land,
is that there are various electrical disturbances that
intercept and confuse the wireless waves. In other
words, wireless works through mere physical obstructions
without any difficulty, just so long as certain
little known electrical disturbances do not interfere.
Just think of the thousands and thousands of wireless
messages that are passing through the ether every
hour of the day and night. And yet the scientists
really know very little about the laws that govern
them!</p>

<p>One of the instances of the strange antics of wireless
was told to the boy by an operator who had been
in charge of the wireless outfit on a Hudson River
boat. He said that he and the operators on the other
boats were able to communicate with a station on
shore until they had passed the Poughkeepsie bridge,
and the great steel and stone structure stretched
between the boat and the station. Immediately communication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
stopped short and all efforts failed to
get any response. A series of experiments proved
that the obstruction was at the bridge, but whether
it was some electrical property in the bridge itself,
or in the hills on each side of the bridge, they have
never been able to find out, and the land station
was finally discontinued.</p>

<p>This is just an instance of what the scientists do
<i>not</i> know about wireless, but it shows the many boy
amateurs that there are still worlds for them to conquer
in scientific research.</p>

<p>The central principle upon which the wireless telegraph
works now is the same as it was when Marconi,
through his marvellous invention, first received a
signal from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, but
the inventors have learned much more about the
details of the theory and it is in the improvement of
devices for applying these laws of electricity that the
development has been, rather than in the discovery
of new theories. Nikola Tesla's invention for the
wireless transmission of power by earth waves is a
revolutionary departure from the usual wireless practice,
but as we saw in the earlier chapter on this
subject the Tesla invention has not yet been put
in practical operation.</p>

<p>Though Guglielmo Marconi did not discover the
laws of electricity upon which his invention is based,
to him belongs all the credit for making use of the
discoveries of the scientists of his day, and working
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
out from them a practical system of wireless communication.</p>

<p>As many boys know, the wireless telegraph is
possible through the radiation of electric waves. For
instance, if a stone is thrown into a pool waves are
started out in every direction from the point where
the water is disturbed. The water does not move
except up and down, and yet the waves pass on until
they reach the side of the pool, or their force is
expended.</p>

<p>The scientists before Marconi found out that when
an electric spark was made to jump between two
magnetic poles it started electric waves in every
direction, much like the stone thrown into the pool,
except at a speed that is reckoned at 186,000 miles
per second.</p>

<p>Prof. Amos Dolbear, of Tufts College, Massachusetts,
first made use of these waves in 1880, and a few
years later Doctor Hertz, conducting experiments
along the same lines, discovered them. Since that
time these waves have been called Hertzian waves.</p>

<p>For many years scientists had understood that
electrical waves or vibrations travelled through the
ether in a copper wire, and that gave us telegraphy
by wires, but it was a new thing to think of the waves
travelling in every direction through space without
wires. These early investigators found out that they
could detect these waves by a device called a Hertzian
loop, which was simply a copper wire bent into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
hoop with the two ends close together but not touching.
A spark would appear between the ends of the
wire when the electric waves were sent out.</p>

<p>Marconi began his work where these scientists
left off, as a very young man on his father's farm in
Italy, but soon went to England, of which country
his mother was a native, and placed the results of
his experiments before the government authorities.
Continuing his labors he soon had his wireless apparatus
worked out in the form in which it first became
known to the world.</p>

<p>It consisted of a transmitter, receiving machine
or detector, and a set of antenn√¶ or aerial wires from
which the electrical waves were sent. For his transmitter,
he created a spark between the two brass knobs
on the ends of two thick brass wires by closing and
opening an electrical circuit with a key, very much
like, but somewhat larger than the regulation telegraph
key. The space between the knobs was called
the spark gap. For a dash he would hold down
his key and make a large spark, and for a dot he
would release his key quickly and make only a short
one. Thus, he could send the regular Morse or
Continental telegraphic codes of dots and dashes.
These impulses were transmitted by wires to the
aerial wires, or antenn√¶. The impulses left the
antenn√¶ as electro-magnetic waves, and went forth in
all directions, only to be caught on the antenn√¶ of
another station aboard a ship or on land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
Here is where the receiver did its work, and
the problem was a far more difficult one than the
working out of the transmitter, for the waves as
received were too weak in themselves to register
a dot or a dash. In Marconi's first instruments he
used a device called the "coherer." This was a glass
tube about as big around as a lead pencil, and perhaps
two inches long. It was plugged at each end with
silver, and the narrow space between the plugs was
filled with finely powdered fragments of nickel and
silver, which possess the strange property of being
alternately very good and very bad electrical conductors.
The waves in Marconi's first experiments
were received on a suspended kite wire, exactly
similar to the wire used in the transmitter, but they
were so weak that they could not of themselves
operate an ordinary telegraph instrument. They
possessed strength enough, however, to draw the
little particles of silver and nickel in the coherer
together in a continuous metal path. In other words,
they made these particles "cohere," and the moment
they cohered they became a good conductor for
electricity, and a current from a battery near at hand
rushed through the connection, operated the Morse
instrument, and caused it to print a dot or a dash;
then a little tapper, actuated by the same current,
struck against the coherer, the particles of metal
were broken apart, becoming a poor conductor, and
cutting off the current from the home battery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
In Marconi's early experiments there was little
or no attempt at tuning the instruments for waves
of certain lengths, but this art has been developed
to a high state in modern wireless telegraphy and we
shall see how the operator tunes his instruments to
talk to any one special station.</p>

<p>The distinguishing feature of the modern wireless
transmitter, now familiar to every boy who has ever
taken a trip aboard a large ship, or attended an
electrical show, as it was in the old days, is the
"crack, crack, cr-r-r-ack, crack" of the spark as it
flickers between the brass knobs of the instrument,
as the operator pounds away at his key. In some of
the great high-power land stations, where long
distance work is done the crash of the spark is like
that of thunder, the flame is as big around as a man's
wrist and of such intensity that it could not be looked
at with unshaded eyes. On ships where the crash
is too loud it has become necessary to cover the
spark gap with a wooden muffler so as to deaden the
noise.</p>

<p>While the simple spark gap of the early Marconi
instruments was enough to send out the Hertzian
waves, the modern transmitter is a marvel of electrical
construction utilizing as it does the latest
discoveries in electrical apparatus.</p>

<p>The most noticeable difference in the sending
apparatus is in the arrangement of the two wires
between which the spark flies. In the early instruments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
the wires were set in a horizontal line, and
connected to an induction coil, but in the later ones
the oscillator was turned up lengthwise with the
spark gap between the vertical wings.</p>

<p>The different position of the spark gap is a change
only in form, and not in principle. In the Marconi
apparatus used nowadays the current comes from a
dynamo of more than 110 volts, direct current. The
two terminals of the circuit are connected with an
induction coil, and from there to the two ends of the
wires, making the terminals of the spark gap. The
upper wire runs from the spark gap to the aerial, and
the lower runs through a battery of Leyden jars,
through a high tension transformer (as does the other
side of the circuit), and thence to the ground. Aboard
ship the ground connection is simply made by attaching
a wire to the hull of the ship, which is in
connection with the water, the best possible earth
connection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
There are, of course, a great many different kinds
of transmitters, but they are all worked out on the
same general principle&mdash;a spark gap which creates
electrical oscillations that are sent into the ether from
the aerials.</p>

<p>In some modern stations an alternating current is
used at more than 100 volts and is stepped up through
a transformer to about 30,000 volts. This high
power current then charges a condenser consisting
of a battery of Leyden jars.</p>

<p>When the operator presses his key he establishes
a connection, which immediately sets up electrical
waves oscillating at a rate of anywhere from 100,000
to 2,500,000 per second. These oscillations are carried
to the antenn√¶ where they pass into the ether
and spread in all directions to be caught on the aerials
of all stations within range.</p>

<p>One of the improvements in wireless transmission
which makes long distance work possible aboard
ships is the use of what the engineers call "coupled
circuits." The arrangement consists in connecting
the aerial to an induction coil, and connecting the
latter with a ground wire. Another coil is placed
close to this and is connected with the spark gap,
and a condenser. The period of oscillation of the
antenn√¶ circuit, and of the spark gap circuit are
timed to be exactly the same. The two circuits
are then called "coupled circuits," for while they are
coupled together by induction only, the oscillation or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
spark gap circuit increases its capacity, and at the
same time has a small spark gap.</p>

<p>With these new devices for increasing the power
of the oscillations, or in other words throwing a
bigger stone into the pond, the electrical waves are
sent out with far greater force, just as the water
waves are sent farther in the pond, and will reach
stations at a greater distance.</p>

<p>"Crash, bang," goes the oscillator, and in less time
than it takes to think it the oscillations have reached
the antenn√¶ of ships hundreds or thousands of miles
away, or even those of another land station on the
other side of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>The next thing is to understand the apparatus
used for receiving the faint electric waves transmitted
through the ether, for the modern instruments are
far different from the old style "coherer" explained
before. As with the spark gaps, there are many
different styles of receiving devices, all known by the
general name of "detectors," as they detect the
faint electro-magnetic waves radiating through the
ether.</p>

<p>Some of the latest Marconi experiments show a
return to the "coherer" idea, very greatly improved
upon, but the full details of the device have not been
made public.</p>

<p>One of the detecting devices used by the Marconi
system, after the old-style "coherer" was done away
with, was very simple indeed in comparison to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
cohering and tapping machines. It was made up
of a small glass tube wound with copper wire. One
end of this made the ground connection, and the
other end led to the aerial, and also to an earth connection
through a tuning inductance coil. Then
another coil was wound around the first one on the
glass tube and connected with the head telephone
receivers which have taken the place of the Morse
dot and dash printing instrument in all the modern
wireless instruments. Two magnets were placed just
above the glass tube, and a flexible iron wire was made
to move through it by means of a pair of rollers a
little way from each end. When the electro-magnetic
waves reached the aerial and made oscillations in the
first coil about the glass tube, the magnetic intensity
of the iron wire band was disturbed and the glass tube
became an oscillation transformer, setting up currents
in the coil leading to the telephone receivers.
The impulses were manifested by ticks, just the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
length of the dots and dashes being sent out by
the operator perhaps thousands of miles away.</p>

<p>Another form of detector is the "electrolytic"
which consists of a very fine platinum wire about
one ten-thousandth of an inch in diameter, which
dips into a platinum cup filled with nitric acid. When
the invisible electro-magnetic waves impinge upon
the wires of the receiving station, and cause electrical
surges to take place in those wires, they in
turn affect the detector, giving an exact reproduction
of the note of the transmitting spark at the
distant station.</p>

<p>This device has since been replaced by one of
another type, equally sensitive and much better
suited for general work on account of its greater
stability and freedom from atmospheric disturbances.
This detector consists simply of a crystal of carborundum
supported between two brass points. When
connected to the antenn√¶ it is affected by the oscillations
caused by distant transmitting stations as previously
stated. These wireless signals are reproduced
in telephone receivers.</p>

<p>Another frequently used detector known as the
Audion is composed of a small incandescent lamp
with filaments of carbon, tantalum, or preferably
tungsten, and one or more sheets or wings of platinum
secured near the filaments. The lamp is lighted by
a set of home batteries, and is connected with a
ground wire, the aerial, and the telephone receivers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
The tungsten filament and the platinum wing act
as two electrodes, and the faint electric oscillations
received on the antenn√¶ and transmitted to the
platinum plate are supposed to affect the discharge
of negatively electrified particles, or ions, between
the two electrodes. This affects the flow of the
battery current, and consequently registers the oscillations
in the telephone receivers.</p>

<p>By diligent study of the subject the wireless experts
also have learned that the arrangement of the aerials
is of great importance, because much depends upon
the send-off received by the electrical oscillations.
In Marconi's early experiments he used a single
wire attached to a kite, then changed to a single
wire stretched from the top of a high mast. Later, the
system of stretching the wires horizontally between
two masts, as we see them so often aboard passenger
steamships, and at land stations, came into general
use. The old idea that the height of the aerial
wires had something to do with the efficiency of the
apparatus has passed, for science showed that the
electro-magnetic waves travelled in all directions
irrespective of land, water, mountains, or buildings.
Whether, in sending messages across the ocean, they
actually pass through the globe, or follow the curve
of the surface, is more than the most careful wireless
students have been able to tell.</p>

<p>Another of the big improvements in wireless is
in the tuning of the instruments to certain wave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
lengths or rates of vibrations, and in controlling the
wave lengths by the sender. Science has established
that these waves usually vary from a few feet up
to 12,000 feet or more. The ordinary wave lengths
for ships is between 1,000 feet and 1,800 feet, but
on the biggest land stations and the transatlantic
liners the full 12,000 feet is used. Even greater
lengths of waves are used by the big Marconi
stations transmitting messages between Clifden, on
the west coast of Ireland, and Glace Bay, Nova
Scotia. The reason for this is that with the same
power messages can be sent greater distances with
long wave lengths than with shorter ones.</p>

<p>The wave length is controlled by an apparatus
called the "helix," which may be seen in the picture
of the wireless outfit. It looks like a drum wound
with a spiral of copper tubing, and although it looks
simple it presents some of the greatest problems in
connection with wireless.</p>

<p>On the receiving end is the instrument called the
tuner, by which the operator can adjust his detector to
the wave lengths being sent out by the station with
which he wishes to talk. There are various kinds of
"tuners," all more or less complicated. The device
corresponds to the telephone exchange or the telegraph
switch-board. Of course a good receiving apparatus
can be tuned so that the operator can listen to any
messages going through the ether, within range, but
all messages that are intended to be secret are sent in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
code, just as all wire and cable messages that are
secret are sent in code.</p>

<p>In line with the advent of wireless telegraphy it
is fitting that we should have the wireless telephone.
While this instrument is still in the experimental
stage, some very promising results have been obtained.
There are several experimental wireless
telephone stations in New York City, but the best
results are obtained when some one keeps up a
steady conversation, so it is far easier to connect the
reproducer of a phonograph to the transmitter of
the wireless telephone. It is surprising how distinctly
this music or speech is received. In fact
the ship operators nearing New York are often
entertained by strains of music from these wireless
telephones. The wireless telephones employ what
are known as undamped oscillations created by
electric arcs, and it is very easy to "tune out" such
vibrations for musical effects.</p>

<p>Just as we have the motion-picture "newspaper,"
we have the wireless newspaper published aboard
the big transatlantic liners every day. The news
is sent out from certain land stations at certain
times in the day and night, and every ship within
range copies it, and publishes it just as our regular
daily papers are published. Of course, the paper
is small, but it usually contains most of the important
news of the day, the big sporting items, such as baseball
scores, and the stock quotations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
In the United States the great station at Wellfleet,
Cape Cod, Mass., sends out the press matter each
night from dispatches prepared in the main offices
of the big American press associations. Ships as
far as 1,600 miles distant frequently receive this news
matter, and by the time the ocean-going editor is
ready to get out his next day's edition he is in touch
with the wireless press station on the other side, and
is receiving the world's news from the English coast.</p>

<p>As our young friend found out when he was gathering
up all the information he could about aeroplanes,
some success has been made in the equipment of the
fliers with wireless. The project offers some serious
difficulties, however, as on an aeroplane there is
no place for long aerials. Experiments have been
tried with long trailing wires, but these are dangerous
to the aeroplane, and to use the wires of the machine
for antenn√¶ endangers the operator to electric shocks.
One scheme tried by several aviators in the United
States with some success has been the stringing of
aerials in the rear framework.</p>

<p>The problem of equipping balloons and airships
with wireless is much simpler because it allows of
long trailing wires to act as the antenn√¶. Most
boys will remember the success of the wireless
apparatus that was set up on the <i>America</i> at the
time Walter Wellman made his famous attempt to
cross the Atlantic in his airship.</p>

<p>That wireless will take its place as one of the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
forces in civilization is the idea of Guglielmo Marconi,
the inventor of the wireless telegraph, expressed when
he was in New York in the spring of 1912.</p>

<p>"I believe," he said, "that in the near future a
wireless message will be sent from New York completely
round the globe with no relaying, and will
be received by an instrument located in the same
office as the transmitter, in perhaps even less time
than Shakespeare's forty minutes.</p>

<p>"Most messages across the Atlantic will probably
go by wireless at a comparatively early date. In
time of war wireless connections will be invaluable.
The enemy can cut cables and telegraph wires; but
it is difficult seriously to damage the wireless service.
The British Empire has realized this, and is already
equipping many of its outposts with wireless stations."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
MORE MARVELS OF SCIENCE</h2>
</div>

<p class="hanging">COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHY, THE TUNGSTEN ELECTRIC
LAMP, THE PULMOTOR, AND OTHER NEW INVENTIONS
INVESTIGATED BY OUR BOY FRIEND</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>EFORE we leave our good friend the scientist
and his young companion, let us go over a
few more of the things about which they
talked. To take up all of them would be to prolong
this book indefinitely, for the boy's mind was ever
unfolding to the new things of the world and with
each subject mastered, or at least partially understood,
he was anxious to go on to the next. Not
that he did not have his special hobbies upon which
he spent most of his time, for he did, but that did not
prevent his inquiring young mind from reaching out
for new and more wonderful things once he had come
to realize the world of marvels in which we live.</p>

<p>One of this youth's favourite pastimes was photography,
and as an amateur his work had attracted
considerable attention from his friends. One day
in the summer, when all the trees, shrubs, and flowers
were at the height of their beauty, he came into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
laboratory where his scientific friend was working
over an experiment.</p>

<p>"I have heard of a process of colour photography,"
he said, "and I wonder if I couldn't make use of it
to get some good pictures out in the country, showing
just exactly how it is."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied his friend. "There are a
number of systems of colour photography now&mdash;all
invented within the last few years. None of them
is perfect though, and you would have the added
fun of carrying on some experiments that might
bring to light some valuable knowledge.</p>

<p>"While it is possible to make coloured photographic
prints now, by means of a specially treated paper,
colour photography is best known as a means of
making beautiful transparent glass plates and lantern
slides. When held up to the light, the transparencies
give an accurate picture of the scene in natural
colours. The paper I mention can be bought at the
photographic houses, but the inventors do not claim
yet that their process is so perfect as to give exact
reproductions of all the shades of colours unless they
are well defined in the positive plates. The prints
are made from the positive transparencies in just
the same way that photographic prints are made from
black and white photographic plates."</p>

<p>"Let's try some colour photographs," promptly
said the boy. "Will you go out into the country
with me some Saturday and help me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
"I certainly will be glad to go with you, but you
are a better photographer than I am, for you see,
about the only kind of photography I do now is with
a microscope, such as you have looked through here
many times. Your own regular camera and tripod
will be all you will need, for I will buy the colour
plates upon which the pictures are to be taken."</p>

<p>They made their trip to the country on the first
pleasant Saturday, and while they were out the scientist
explained many points about the system.</p>

<p>"Years ago," he said, "even before that wonderful
Frenchman, Daguerre, invented light photography,
scientists were trying to discover some means of
mechanically registering on paper, the beautiful
things they saw in nature, in their natural colours,
as well as in their natural form in black and white.
All through the years of the development of photography
with light and shadow, scientists never
relaxed their search for some way of photographing
colours. Although many of them hit upon the
colour screen idea by which it finally was accomplished,
there remained years and years of patient
experiment. Prof. James Clark Maxwell, Ducos du
Hauron, Doctor Konig, Sanger Shepherd, and, in
later years, Frederick Eugene Ives, of Philadelphia,
all worked on the idea.</p>

<p>"In 1907, however, Antoine Lumi√©re, of the famous
French photographic house that bears his name,
announced a system of colour photography which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
has grown in popularity ever since. The system,
which is known as the autochrome, was the result
of many years patient study and research with his
sons who are associated in business with him."</p>

<p>The scientist then went on to explain that in
attacking the problem the investigators first had
to learn all they could about colours, and how they
are reflected by light rays. As we have seen in the
colour process for motion pictures there are really
only three fundamental or primary colours, and all
other shades and tints are made up from combinations
of these. The three are blue-violet, green, and
orange-red, and a screen of these forms the foundation
of all the colour plates now used.</p>

<p>In the autochrome process the lowly potato, which
we generally think of merely as a common article
of our food, forms the first factor. The starch
of the potato is ground down and sifted so that the
grains are the same size&mdash;not more than 0.0004
to 0.0005 of an inch in diameter. These grains then
are divided into three equal portions, and each portion
is dyed, respectively, blue-violet, green, and orange-red.
The three little piles of starch grains are then
mixed together in suitable amounts and dusted on to
a plate, which has previously been coated with a
substance to make them stick. The difficulty in dusting
on the starch grains is great, for they must cover
the whole plate equally and yet not make any piles
of starch at any one point, for to have several grains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
on top of one another would spoil the effect. The
extreme delicacy of this operation will be appreciated
when it is realized that there are over five million
grains to the square inch. When the starch is all
properly placed it makes the colour screen, though
in appearance the plate is a dark gray.</p>

<p>The plate is next put through a rolling process
so that all the grains are flattened out to form a
mosaic covering over the whole surface. In spite of
all the manufacturers can do there will still be some
microscopic spaces between the particles, and these
are filled up with a fine powder of carbon to prevent
the passage of light.</p>

<p>The screen is then coated with a very thin layer
of varnish and upon this is laid a thin and extremely
sensitive photographic emulsion.</p>

<p>"And so that is the way these autochrome plates
we have here were made," concluded the scientist.
"Now our troubles begin, for we must be careful
to give them a fair trial with the proper kind of an
exposure and the proper kind of development."</p>

<p>As the plates are extremely sensitive to all kinds
of light the scientist cautioned the boy against loading
the camera carelessly. It is better, he said, to
load in a dark room.</p>

<p>In putting the plates in the camera the plates are
reversed and instead of placing the sensitized side
toward the lens, the uncoated glass is put in front
and the photograph is taken through the glass. Thus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
the image first passes through the glass, next, through
the grains of coloured starch, and, lastly, is recorded
on the sensitive photographic emulsion.</p>

<p>Before loading the camera, however, the scientist
fitted a yellow colour screen over the lens, explaining
that this was necessary to absorb some of the overactive
blue-violet light rays, to which the emulsion
is extremely sensitive.</p>

<p>In exposing the plate what happens is this: Suppose
a green field is to be photographed. The green
rays of light, reflected from the field, pass through the
lens, and through the glass support of the plate. But
when they reach the coloured starch, the green rays
pass through the green particles of starch, but not
through the violet-blue particles, or the orange-red
particles, for the grains of other colours absorb
the green rays and hold them. Thus, development
would show that the green light rays passing through
the green starch particles caused the emulsion to
darken under the green particles in just the proportion
in which the green light reached them, and to
record the image they carried. As the light would
not pass through the other coloured particles they
would not record any image. Thus a negative is
produced, as we have seen, not the colour we see in
life but the complement. By treating the plate with
a solvent of silver the tiny black specks that were
brought out behind each green particle are removed
and each starch grain is allowed to transmit exactly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
the colour we see in life. In other words, we have a
positive.</p>

<p>This is just as true of all the shades and hues as it
is of the three fundamental colours, for the various
rays of light will penetrate the starch in just the proportion
of the hues they represent in the scene before
our eyes. While the silver solvent will remove the
dark images built up by the penetration of green
light, it will leave behind the particles of red-orange,
and blue-violet, backed up by the creamy silver
bromide of the emulsion. If above the green field
we had a blue sky, the blue-violet particles would
let the blue-violet rays penetrate them, and record
the image of the sky.</p>

<p>After the negative has been treated and made a
positive, a second development reduces the silver
bromide to opaque metallic silver, preventing any
light from passing through the grains through which
a part of the image did not pass. This second bath
also brightens the colours, while the hypo bath
removes the unaltered silver bromide ensuring permanency
to the image.</p>

<p>"Of course in taking these colour photographs,"
went on the scientist, "we must take into consideration
a great many things, to which the manufacturers
will call your attention in their booklets. The exposure
is the most important part of all, for these
plates are necessarily slow and must be exposed for
a much longer time than the ordinary rapid plates.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
For instance, this field, with this bright summer sunlight,
will require a full second with this lens at U.
S. 4."</p>

<p>The scientist then went on to give the boy directions
for developing his colour plates, as follows:</p>

<p>The whole process of development consists of three
operations and but two solutions are required, one
of them being kept preferably in two stock solutions.

<p>As soon as development is finished rinse the plate
briefly, immerse in equal parts of the reversing
solutions and carry the tray into bright daylight.
Gradually the image clears and the true colours are

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
again, still in daylight, in the developer. In three

<p>It should be applied cold in the usual way, making
sure that the entire surface is covered, and then
setting the plate on edge to dry.</p>

<p>The other colour processes now used with success
also are based upon the colour screen.</p>

<p>The process known as the omnicolore, which was
brought out in France, depends upon a screen consisting
of a very fine network of violet lines in one
direction, crossed by red and green lines at right
angles. The usual sensitive emulsion is placed over
these. The lines run more than two hundred to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
inch but they can be seen by close examination of
the plate.</p>

<p>In the Thames process which was brought out in
England the colour screen and the sensitive emulsion
are on separate plates which must be bound together
during exposure and again placed in register or in
exactly the same relative position after development.
This causes some trouble, but reduces expense as the
failures waste the sensitive plates but not the colour
screens. The primary colours instead of being
scattered at random, as in the autochrome system,
are arranged in a pattern to give the proper proportions
to each. The red-orange and green particles
are arranged in circles, with the green a little larger
than the red ones, while the blue particles fill the
spaces.</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>THE NEWEST ELECTRIC LIGHTS</h3>
</div>

<p>One evening our boy friend entered the scientist's
laboratory and found it more brilliantly illuminated
than it ever had been before.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," he said looking up at the ceiling,
"those new electric lights up there are tungsten
lamps. It certainly makes a difference in the looks
of this place."</p>

<p>"Lights up all the dingy corners, doesn't it?"
answered his friend. "You remember," he continued,
"we talked last week about some of the new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
kinds of electric light and that made me think that
I might just as well take advantage of what other
scientists have done and install this newest kind of
electric lamps."</p>

<p>From the ceiling were suspended several stationary
fixtures with bright glass reflectors. The lamps
the boy saw were somewhat larger than the usual
electric light bulbs, and gave off a beautiful white
light instead of the slightly yellowish illumination
that comes from the ordinary ones. He saw that
the filament from which the illumination came was
not arranged in a series of horseshoe curves, as in
the case of the ordinary globes, but that it was strung
between the ends of cross trees, or "spiders," so
that there was a greater total length of filament in
the same size bulb than in the ones used before the
invention of the tungsten lamp. It is a sight familiar
enough to most boys in these days of the rapid adoption
of new inventions, but it brought to the boy's
mind a question that had often occurred to him
before.</p>

<p>"Who invented tungsten lights?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, it would hardly be right to say that any
one individual invented them, for they were really
a development of science worked out by many men,
who studied the problem for many years. This
caused a number of very bitter lawsuits over the
patents and brought about the imprisonment of
one United States patent office official who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
convicted of falsifying the records at Washington
to help one of the inventors. This inventor was
John Allen Heany, and his patents were rejected
finally, the rights of the tungsten filament going
to the General Electric Company. The name 'tungsten'
is taken from the material of which filament,
or the little wire which lights up in the globe,
is made."</p>

<p>"What is tungsten?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Tungsten is a metal that for a great many years
some of our most prominent chemists and scientific investigators
declared could not be put to the use we
see it here," answered the man.</p>

<p>Noticing that the boy leaned forward in his chair,
keen on his every word, the boy's friend continued
his description of this strange metal that has been put
to work lighting us in our march along the road of life.</p>

<p>He explained that tungsten, or wolfram, was discovered
in 1781 and was named from the Swedish
words "tung" (heavy) and "sten" (stone). The
mineral is not found in a pure state but rather in
wolframite, which is what the scientists call a tungstate
of iron and manganese, and also in schoolite
which is calcium tungstate. Pure tungsten is bright
steel gray, very hard, and very heavy. It is one of
the most brittle of all the metals and for that reason
was put to very few uses before the invention of the
tungsten lamp. It was most commonly used, however,
in various steel processes, to harden the metal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
From the time Edison invented the incandescent
lamp in 1879, right up to the present electricians
have tried to get a better electric light filament. A
number of persons conceived the idea of making a
filament of tungsten on account of its peculiar
characteristics, which seemed to be just about the
ones needed for the ideal electric light globe.</p>

<p>In its fundamental idea the tungsten lamp is not
very greatly different from the early Edison incandescent
lamps, but in the application of the principle there
is half a century of accomplishment packed into
a little over a quarter of a century of years. Edison
saw that he must have a filament that would carry
the current of electricity, but yet one which would
be of such high resistance that it would not take
up all the current fed to it. He saw that he had to
have a filament that would heat to incandescence
with the electrical current, and yet one that would
stand a certain amount of wear and tear, and which
would not be consumed by the heat. To obtain the
latter effect he put his filament in an air-tight glass
globe from which the atmosphere was exhausted,
leaving it in a vacuum. As there was no air,
there was no oxygen, and hence there could be
no oxidization, or, in other words, combustion of the
filament.</p>

<p>Edison thought that success lay in a carbon filament,
and in these early days when he was experimenting
at his Menlo Park laboratory he carbonized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
just about everything he could lay his hands on and
tried heating the result to incandescence in the
vacuum globe. Finally, on October 21, he carbonized
a piece of cotton thread and put it in his vacuum
globe in the form of a horseshoe loop. On connecting
it with his electric circuit he was rewarded by seeing
a brilliant incandescent light that lasted without
dimming for forty straight hours.</p>

<p>What a dim, dingy little light it was in comparison
to the world famous lights that Edison now puts
forth! And yet in one way it was the most brilliant
light that ever had shone in the world, for it showed
mankind the pathway toward a complete system of
electric lighting by incandescent lamps.</p>

<p>The carbonized cotton thread filament had many
drawbacks, and Edison continued carbonizing various
fabrics and fibres, including, it is said, some of the
red hairs out of the beard of one of his loyal staff! At
last he hit upon a filament made of carbonized
Japanese bamboo that was very successful for a
number of years, but this was later superseded by a
cellulose mixture mechanically pressed out by dies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, several investigators began work with
tungsten and a similar metal called tantalum because
of their extremely high melting points, high resistance,
and other technical characteristics favourable
for an incandescent filament.</p>

<p>For years they had no success because the metal
was so very brittle that they could do nothing with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
it, but finally a filament of pressed tungsten was
brought out. In this type of lamp several filament
loops would be fused or welded together to make one
complete filament. The result was a very fine
light, but the little wire was too fragile to stand
hard usage, and owing to the fact that the various
connected loops were not all of exactly the same
thickness, one frequently burned out far ahead of the
others and caused early lamp failure.</p>

<p>The next step, and the one which a great many
scientists had declared impossible, was the manufacture
of a tungsten wire through a regular process
of drawing it out through dies to the desired length,
and in the desired thickness. The investigators had
declared that in spite of all they could do, tungsten
was too brittle ever to be drawn into wire. In the
latest methods this is accomplished with such perfection
that tungsten wire of 0.0015 of an inch in
diameter is produced.</p>

<p>"With the invention of a method for drawing out
tungsten wire," continued the scientist, "an almost
ideal lamp was practically accomplished. The wire
simply was strung on the spiders or cross pieces, and
a filament of almost any length giving almost any
desired candlepower light could be used.</p>

<p>"You see in an incandescent light the higher the
melting point of the filament the greater the quantity
of light for the amount of electricity used. Also
tungsten has a low vapour tension, which prevents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
discolouration of the globe by the evaporation of
the filament. It also has other advantages which
are too technical for us to go into.</p>

<p>"Of course, tungsten lamps still have the drawback
of being rather delicate. When not in use, and when
the filament is cold, it is apt to break with rough
treatment, but when lighted the filament, being at a
white heat, is more durable. This delicacy of the
tungsten lamp is the reason the fixtures for most
of them are placed in stationary positions, rather
than on swinging drop cords, as is the case with so
many carbon incandescent lights.</p>

<p>"While the tungsten lamp is far from perfect, it
is a great advance over other forms, and an advance
in the right direction, for it gives a better light with
a smaller consumption of electricity than other types.
I think your father will agree with me that anything
that will help ever so little to reduce the high cost
of living is a benefit."</p>

<p>"But," answered the boy, "there are other new
kinds of electric lights besides tungsten, aren't
there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, but they are hardly as generally
used as the tungsten light. There is the mercury
light about which you read in 'The Second Boys'
Book of Inventions,' several new kinds of arc lights,
the Nernst light, the tantalum lamp (which we know
is much like the tungsten lamp with the exception
that in the latter each loop of the wire can be made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
longer), and the new carbon dioxide gas electric
light, which is a very good imitation of daylight.</p>

<p>"From all our little scientific journeys you have
doubtless formed the idea that light is not the simple
thing it seems, and that the rays of different kinds
of light will bear a limitless amount of study. Now
some of the greatest scientists the world ever has
known have spent the best part of their lives trying
to produce a light that would duplicate the beautiful
health-giving rays of the sun. This light we are
speaking of comes as near to it as any."</p>

<p>He picked up a long glass test tube and holding it
between his fingers said: "Now if this tube were
exhausted of air to a vacuum, and we had an ingenious
little device at each end which would allow just
the right amount&mdash;no more, no less&mdash;of carbon
dioxide gas to enter it, and also we had electrodes
at either end, and connected them to an alternating
current, we would have a rough model of the light
that duplicates daylight.</p>

<p>"In actual practice the vacuum tubes are long, and
turn upon themselves in many lengths. You have
seen these lights in many places, for photographers,
lithographers, dye works, textile mills, and all other
places where the true light of day is necessary for the
judgment of colours are adopting them for their
night work."</p>

<p>"But the light is a ghastly pale blue," interrupted
the boy. "It doesn't look like daylight to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
"No, you are thinking of the mercury light, which
also is strung around in tubes. That has a blue-greenish
tinge to it, and gives people's faces a disagreeable
greenish tinge, but this carbon dioxide
electric light is white with a salmon pink tinge. Of
course it isn't perfect, but the men who developed
it from the work of others who started on this idea
years ago, are constantly at work trying to improve
it."</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>THE PULMOTOR</h3>
</div>

<p>"My father read in the paper to-day about a new
machine called the pulmotor, which he said was one
of the greatest inventions ever brought out," said
our boy friend one day in the winter of 1911-12.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a great invention," replied the scientist,
"and like so many other big things it is so simple we
wonder how it is no one was bright enough to think
of it before. I suppose most of us are too busy
trying to make money."</p>

<p>"My father said it would be a fine thing for
humanity and that it would save hundreds of lives
every year."</p>

<p>"That is true, and the pulmotor is just about the
newest invention of our time, along those lines.
When I first heard of it, I wrote to a friend of mine
in Chicago, where it was brought out, and asked
him about it."</p>

<p>"How does it work?" asked the boy, and ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
willing to explain the marvels of science to his young
friend, the scientist took a pencil and a piece of paper
to illustrate as he talked.</p>

<p>As every boy knows, oxygen is the property in
the air we breathe that gives us life. Also, every boy
knows that physicians and surgeons use pure oxygen
stored in iron tanks to restore respiration to the
lungs of their patients when breathing has almost
stopped. Until the invention of the pulmotor, how
ever, this oxygen was simply introduced into the
patient's lungs by placing the tube in his mouth
and turning on the valve.</p>

<p>The pulmotor <i>makes</i> the patient breathe&mdash;because
it carries on the function for him artificially. "In
Chicago this winter," said the boy's friend, "there
were several cases where the pulmotor brought back
to life people who apparently were dead, from
asphyxiation, or gas poisoning. The machine is most
successful where breathing has stopped through some
unnatural interference, and the rest of the organs
are physically intact, but of course it can be used in
all surgical cases just as the ordinary oxygen tank
is used.</p>

<p>"One case, and probably the one about which your
father was reading," continued the boy's friend,
"was that of a family of three, father, mother and
little girl, who were asphyxiated, and were apparently
dead. The pulmotor pumped pure oxygen into their
lungs until they began to breathe naturally again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
When the pulmotor is unpacked from its little
wooden box, about the size of a suitcase, it looks like
a confusion of rubber tubes and bags. The oxygen is
contained in the tank under high pressure, and this
pressure also furnishes the power to keep up the
artificial breathing.</p>

<div><a name="the_pulmotor" id="the_pulmotor"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_b_372.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">

&ensp;G&mdash;Dashpot bellows. &ensp;H&mdash;Face cap.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The oxygen flows from the tank through a reducing
valve, which cuts down the pressure, and into a
controlling valve whence it flows by a rubber tube
to the face cap which fits tightly over the patient's
nose and mouth. The patient's tongue is kept from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
sliding back into his throat by a pair of forceps placed
for the purpose.</p>

<p>Thus, the oxygen is forced into the lungs by the
pressure, but when it reaches a certain degree, about
what it would be in normal breathing, a bellows connected
with the controlling valve is pressed, and the
pressure is turned to suction so that the oxygen that
has been forced into the lungs is brought out, through
the outlet, causing the poisonous gases to be expelled
from the lungs. After the exhalation is complete
the controlling valve works again and another blast of
pure oxygen is sent into the lungs, only to be withdrawn
at the proper moment. This is kept up until
the patient's breathing is normal.</p>

<p>We will leave the scientist and his young friend
here, for already we have spent more time in following
their journeys and talks than we set out to do. We
have not touched upon every invention of the last
ten years or so, nor every important development,
by a long ways, but we have gone far enough to get
a pretty fair idea as to the trend of modern thought
in inventive research.</p>

<p>This is the epoch of electricity, and of the utilization
of all the great forces of Nature that have been
right here to our hands since the world began, but
which it has taken all these thousands of years to
discover and analyze. More and more man is
coming to see that Nature's own forces will carry on
the big works of the world, if they are properly led
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
through an understanding of their laws. We have
aviation because man learned how to utilize the fact
that air gives support; we have wireless telegraphy,
and we will have the wireless transmission of power,
because man learned that Nature has her own perfect
system of carrying electrical currents when they are
properly delivered to her, without any cumbersome
system of wires; we have the Tesla turbine because
its inventor found out that Nature gave steam, gas,
water, and even air, certain properties that are
intangible, and yet stronger far than mere brute
force; and so it goes:</p>

<p>Ever a greater familiarity with Nature leads to
greater progress, and a happier, more interesting
world.</p>
